Overview 



Part I: GEB 

Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering. The book opens with the story of Bach's Musical 
Offering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the Great of Prussia, and was 
requested to improvise upon a theme presented by the King. His improvisations formed the basis 
of that great work. The Musical Offering and its story form a theme upon which I "improvise" 
throughout the book, thus making a sort of "Metamusical Offering". Self-reference and the 
interplay between different levels in Bach are discussed: this leads to a discussion of parallel 
ideas in Escher's drawings and then Godel's Theorem. A brief presentation of the history of logic 
and paradoxes is given as background for Godel's Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning 
and computers, and the debate about whether Artificial Intelligence is possible. I close with an 
explanation of the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the Dialogues. 

Three-Part Invention. Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part Dialogue, the 
Tortoise and Achilles-the main fictional protagonists in the Dialogues-are "invented" by Zeno (as 
in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's paradoxes of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor 
of the Dialogues to come. 

Chapter I: The MU-puzzle. A simple formal system (the MIL'-system) is presented, and the reader 
is urged to work out a puzzle to gain familiarity with formal systems in general. A number of 
fundamental notions are introduced: string, theorem, axiom, rule of inference, derivation, formal 
system, decision procedure, working inside/outside the system. 

Two-Part Invention. Bach also wrote fifteen two-part inventions. This two-part Dialogue was written 
not by me, but by Lewis Carroll in 1895. Carroll borrowed Achilles and the Tortoise from Zeno, 
and I in turn borrowed them from Carroll. The topic is the relation between reasoning, reasoning 
about reasoning, reasoning about reasoning about reasoning, and so on. It parallels, in a way, 
Zeno's paradoxes about the impossibility of motion, seeming to show, by using infinite regress, 
that reasoning is impossible. It is a beautiful paradox, and is referred to several times later in the 
book. 

Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics. A new formal system (the pq-system) is 
presented, even simpler than the MlU-system of Chapter I. Apparently meaningless at first, its 
symbols are suddenly revealed to possess meaning by virtue of the form of the theorems they 
appear in. This revelation is the first important insight into meaning: its deep connection to 
isomorphism. Various issues related to meaning are then discussed, such as truth, proof, symbol 
manipulation, and the elusive concept, "form". 

Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles. A Dialogue which imitates the Bach Sonatas for 
unaccompanied violin. In particular, Achilles is the only speaker, since it is a transcript of one 
end of a telephone call, at the far end of which is the Tortoise. Their conversation concerns the 
concepts of "figure" and "ground" in various 



Overview 



IV 



contexts- e.g., Escher's art. The Dialogue itself forms an example of the distinction, since 
Achilles' lines form a "figure", and the Tortoise's lines-implicit in Achilles' lines-form a "ground". 

Chapter III: Figure and Ground. The distinction between figure and ground in art is compared to 
the distinction between theorems and nontheorems in formal systems. The question "Does a 
figure necessarily contain the same information as its ground%" leads to the distinction between 
recursively enumerable sets and recursive sets. 

Contracrostipunctus. This Dialogue is central to the book, for it contains a set of paraphrases of 
Godel's self-referential construction and of his Incompleteness Theorem. One of the paraphrases 
of the Theorem says, "For each record player there is a record which it cannot play." The 
Dialogue's title is a cross between the word "acrostic" and the word "contrapunctus", a Latin word 
which Bach used to denote the many fugues and canons making up his Art of the Fugue. Some 
explicit references to the Art of the Fugue are made. The Dialogue itself conceals some acrostic 
tricks. 

Chapter IV: Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry. The preceding Dialogue is explicated to 
the extent it is possible at this stage. This leads back to the question of how and when symbols in 
a formal system acquire meaning. The history of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry is given, 
as an illustration of the elusive notion of "undefined terms". This leads to ideas about the 
consistency of different and possibly "rival" geometries. Through this discussion the notion of 
undefined terms is clarified, and the relation of undefined terms to perception and thought 
processes is considered. 

Little Harmonic Labyrinth. This is based on the Bach organ piece by the same name. It is a playful 
introduction to the notion of recursive-i.e., nested structures. It contains stories within stories. The 
frame story, instead of finishing as expected, is left open, so the reader is left dangling without 
resolution. One nested story concerns modulation in music-particularly an organ piece which 
ends in the wrong key, leaving the listener dangling without resolution. 

Chapter V: Recursive Structures and Processes. The idea of recursion is presented in many 
different contexts: musical patterns, linguistic patterns, geometric structures, mathematical 
functions, physical theories, computer programs, and others. 

Canon by Intervallic Augmentation. Achilles and the Tortoise try to resolve the question, "Which 
contains more information-a record, or the phonograph which plays it This odd question arises 
when the Tortoise describes a single record which, when played on a set of different 
phonographs, produces two quite different melodies: B-A-C-H and C-A-G-E. It turns out, 
however, that these melodies are "the same", in a peculiar sense. 

Chapter VI: The Location of Meaning. A broad discussion of how meaning is split among coded 
message, decoder, and receiver. Examples presented include strands of DNA, undeciphered 
inscriptions on ancient tablets, and phonograph records sailing out in space. The relationship of 
intelligence to "absolute" meaning is postulated. 

Chromatic Fantasy, And Feud. A short Dialogue bearing hardly any resemblance, except in title, to 
Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue. It concerns the proper way to manipulate sentences so as 
to preserve truth-and in particular the question

V 



of whether there exist rules for the usage of the word "arid". This Dialogue has much in common 
with the Dialogue by Lewis Carroll. 

Chapter VII: The Propositional Calculus. It is suggested how words such as .,and" can be 
governed by formal rules. Once again, the ideas of isomorphism and automatic acquisition of 
meaning by symbols in such a system are brought up. All the examples in this Chapter, 
incidentally, are "Zentences"-sentences taken from Zen koans. This is purposefully done, 
somewhat tongue-in-cheek, since Zen koans are deliberately illogical stories. 

Crab Canon. A Dialogue based on a piece by the same name from the Musical Offering. Both are so 
named because crabs (supposedly) walk backwards. The Crab makes his first appearance in this 
Dialogue. It is perhaps the densest Dialogue in the book in terms of formal trickery and level- 
play. Godel, Escher, and Bach are deeply intertwined in this very short Dialogue. 

Chapter VIII: Typographical Number Theory. An extension of the Propositional Calculus called 
"TNT" is presented. In TNT, number-theoretical reasoning can be done by rigid symbol 
manipulation. Differences between formal reasoning and human thought are considered. 

A Mu Offering. This Dialogue foreshadows several new topics in the book. Ostensibly concerned 
with Zen Buddhism and koans, it is actually a thinly veiled discussion of theoremhood and 
nontheoremhood, truth and falsity, of strings in number theory. There are fleeting references to 
molecular biology-particular) the Genetic Code. There is no close affinity to the Musical 
Offering, other than in the title and the playing of self-referential games. 

Chapter IX: Mumon and Godel. An attempt is made to talk about the strange ideas of Zen 
Buddhism. The Zen monk Mumon, who gave well known commentaries on many koans, is a 
central figure. In a way, Zen ideas bear a metaphorical resemblance to some contemporary ideas 
in the philosophy of mathematics. After this "Zennery", Godel's fundamental idea of Godel- 
numbering is introduced, and a first pass through Godel's Theorem is made. 

Part II: EGB 

Prelude ... This Dialogue attaches to the next one. They are based on preludes and fugues from 
Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Achilles and the Tortoise bring a present to the Crab, who has a 
guest: the Anteater. The present turns out to be a recording of the W.T.C.; it is immediately put 
on. As they listen to a prelude, they discuss the structure of preludes and fugues, which leads 
Achilles to ask how to hear a fugue: as a whole, or as a sum of parts? This is the debate between 
holism and reductionism, which is soon taken up in the Ant Fugue. 

Chapter X: Levels of Description, and Computer Systems. Various levels of seeing pictures, 
chessboards, and computer systems are discussed. The last of these is then examined in detail. 
This involves describing machine languages, assembly languages, compiler languages, operating 
systems, and so forth. Then the discussion turns to composite systems of other types, such as 
sports teams, nuclei, atoms, the weather, and so forth. The question arises as to how man 
intermediate levels exist-or indeed whether any exist. 



Overview 



VI 



...Ant Fugue. An imitation of a musical fugue: each voice enters with the same statement. The 
theme-holism versus reductionism-is introduced in a recursive picture composed of words 
composed of smaller words, etc. The words which appear on the four levels of this strange picture 
are "HOLISM", "REDLCTIONIsM", and "ML". The discussion veers off to a friend of the 
Anteater's Aunt Hillary, a conscious ant colony. The various levels of her thought processes are 
the topic of discussion. Many fugal tricks are ensconced in the Dialogue. As a hint to the reader, 
references are made to parallel tricks occurring in the fugue on the record to which the foursome 
is listening. At the end of the Ant Fugue, themes from the Prelude return, transformed 
considerably. 

Chapter XI: Brains and Thoughts. "How can thoughts he supported by the hardware of the brain is 
the topic of the Chapter. An overview of the large scale and small-scale structure of the brain is 
first given. Then the relation between concepts and neural activity is speculatively discussed in 
some detail. 

English French German Suite. An interlude consisting of Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem 
"Jabberwocky M together with two translations: one into French and one into German, both done 
last century. 

Chapter XII: Minds and Thoughts. The preceding poems bring up in a forceful way the question 
of whether languages, or indeed minds, can be "mapped" onto each other. How is communication 
possible between two separate physical brains: What do all human brains have in common? A 
geographical analogy is used to suggest an answer. The question arises, "Can a brain be 
understood, in some objective sense, by an outsider?" 

Aria with Diverse Variations. A Dialogue whose form is based on Bach's Goldberg Variations, and 
whose content is related to number- theoretical problems such as the Goldbach conjecture. This 
hybrid has as its main purpose to show how number theory's subtlety stems from the fact that 
there are many diverse variations on the theme of searching through an infinite space. Some of 
them lead to infinite searches, some of them lead to finite searches, while some others hover in 
between. 

Chapter XIII: BlooP and FlooP and GlooP. These are the names of three computer languages. 
BlooP programs can carry out only predictably finite searches, while FlooP programs can carry 
out unpredictable or even infinite searches. The purpose of this Chapter is to give an intuition for 
the notions of primitive recursive and general recursive functions in number theory, for they are 
essential in Godel's proof. 

Air on G's String. A Dialogue in which Godel's self-referential construction is mirrored in words. 
The idea is due to W. V. O. Quine. This Dialogue serves as a prototype for the next Chapter. 

Chapter XIV: On Formally Undecidable Propositions of TNT and Related Systems. This 
Chapter's title is an adaptation of the title of Godel's 1931 article, in which his Incompleteness 
Theorem was first published. The two major parts of Godel's proof are gone through carefully. It 
is shown how the assumption of consistency of TNT forces one to conclude that TNT (or any 
similar system) is incomplete. Relations to Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry are discussed. 
Implications for the philosophy of mathematics are gone into with some care.

Birthday Cantatatata ... In which Achilles cannot convince the wily and skeptical Tortoise that today 
is his (Achilles') birthday. His repeated but unsuccessful tries to do so foreshadow the 
repeatability of the Godel argument. 

Chapter XV: Jumping out of the System. The repeatability of Godel' s argument is shown, with 
the implication that TNT is not only incomplete, but "essentially incomplete The fairly notorious 
argument by J. R. Lucas, to the effect that Godel's Theorem demonstrates that human thought 
cannot in any sense be "mechanical", is analyzed and found to be wanting. 

Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker. A Dialogue treating of many topics, with the thrust being 
problems connected with self-replication and self-reference. Television cameras filming 
television screens, and viruses and other subcellular entities which assemble themselves, are 
among the examples used. The title comes from a poem by J. S. Bach himself, which enters in a 
peculiar way. 

Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and Self-Rep. This Chapter is about the connection between self-reference 
in its various guises, and self- reproducing entities e.g., computer programs or DNA molecules). 
The relations between a self-reproducing entity and the mechanisms external to it which aid it in 
reproducing itself (e.g., a computer or proteins) are discussed-particularly the fuzziness of the 
distinction. How information travels between various levels of such systems is the central topic of 
this Chapter. 

The Magnificrab, Indeed. The title is a pun on Bach's Magnifacat in D. The tale is about the Crab, 
who gives the appearance of having a magical power of distinguishing between true and false 
statements of number theory by reading them as musical pieces, playing them on his flute, and 
determining whether they are "beautiful" or not. 

Chapter XVII: Church, Turing, Tarski, and Others. The fictional Crab of the preceding Dialogue 
is replaced by various real people with amazing mathematical abilities. The Church-Turing 
Thesis, which relates mental activity to computation, is presented in several versions of differing 
strengths. All are analyzed, particularly in terms of their implications for simulating human 
thought mechanically, or programming into a machine an ability to sense or create beauty. The 
connection between brain activity and computation brings up some other topics: the halting 
problem of Turing, and Tarski's Truth Theorem. 

SHRDLU, Toy of Man's Designing. This Dialogue is lifted out of an article by Terry Winograd on 
his program SHRDLU: only a few names have been changed. In it. a program communicates 
with a person about the so-called "blocks world" in rather impressive English. The computer 
program appears to exhibit some real understanding-in its limited world. The Dialogue's title is 
based on Jesu, joy of Mans Desiring, one movement of Bach's Cantata 147. 

Chapter XVIII: Artificial Intelligence: Retrospects, This Chapter opens with a discussion of the 
famous "Turing test"-a proposal by the computer pioneer Alan Turing for a way to detect the 
presence or absence of "thought" in a machine. From there, we go on to an abridged history of 
Artificial Intelligence. This covers programs that can-to some degree-play games, prove 
theorems, solve problems, compose music, do mathematics, and use "natural language" (e.g., 
English).

Contrafactus. About how we unconsciously organize our thoughts so that we can imagine 
hypothetical variants on the real world all the time. Also about aberrant variants of this ability- 
such as possessed by the new character, the Sloth, an avid lover of French fries, and rabid hater of 
counterfactuals. 

Chapter XIX: Artificial Intelligence: Prospects. The preceding Dialogue triggers a discussion of 
how knowledge is represented in layers of contexts. This leads to the modern Al idea of "frames". 
A frame-like way of handling a set of visual pattern puzzles is presented, for the purpose of 
concreteness. Then the deep issue of the interaction of concepts in general is discussed, which 
leads into some speculations on creativity. The Chapter concludes with a set of personal 
"Questions and Speculations" on Al and minds in general. 

Sloth Canon. A canon which imitates a Bach canon in which one voice plays the same melody as 
another, only upside down and twice as slowly, while a third voice is free. Here, the Sloth utters 
the same lines as the Tortoise does, only negated (in a liberal sense of the term) and twice as 
slowly, while Achilles is free. 

Chapter XX: Strange Loops, Or Tangled Hierarchies. A grand windup of many of the ideas 
about hierarchical systems and self-reference. It is concerned with the snarls which arise when 
systems turn back on themselves-for example, science probing science, government investigating 
governmental wrongdoing, art violating the rules of art, and finally, humans thinking about their 
own brains and minds. Does Godel's Theorem have anything to say about this last "snarl"? Are 
free will and the sensation of consciousness connected to Godel's Theorem? The Chapter ends by 
tying Godel, Escher, and Bach together once again. 

Six-Part Ricercar. This Dialogue is an exuberant game played with many of the ideas which have 
permeated the book. It is a reenactment of the story of the Musical Offering, which began the 
book; it is simultaneously a "translation" into words of the most complex piece in the Musical 
Offering: the Six-Part Ricercar. This duality imbues the Dialogue with more levels of meaning 
than any other in the book. Frederick the Great is replaced by the Crab, pianos by computers, and 
so on. Many surprises arise. The Dialogue's content concerns problems of mind, consciousness, 
free will, Artificial Intelligence, the Turing test, and so forth, which have been introduced earlier. 
It concludes with an implicit reference to the beginning of the book, thus making the book into 
one big self-referential loop, symbolizing at once Bach's music, Escher's drawings, and Godel's 
Theorem.

Introduction: 



A Musico-Logical Offering 

Author: 

FREDERICK THE GREAT, King of Prussia, came to power in 1740. Although he is 
remembered in history books mostly for his military astuteness, he was also devoted to 
the life of the mind and the spirit. His court in Potsdam was one of the great centers of 
intellectual activity in Europe in the eighteenth century. The celebrated mathematician 
Leonhard Euler spent twenty-five years there. Many other mathematicians and scientists 
came, as well as philosophers-including Voltaire and La Mettrie, who wrote some of their 
most influential works while there. 

But music was Frederick's real love. He was an avid flutist and composer. Some of his 
compositions are occasionally performed even to this day. Frederick was one of the first 
patrons of the arts to recognize the virtues of the newly developed "piano-forte" ("soft- 
loud"). The piano had been developed in the first half of the eighteenth century as a 
modification of the harpsichord. The problem with the harpsichord was that pieces could 
only be played at a rather uniform loudness-there was no way to strike one note more 
loudly than its neighbors. The "soft-loud", as its name implies, provided a remedy to this 
problem. From Italy, where Bartolommeo Cristofori had made the first one, the soft-loud 
idea had spread widely. Gottfried Silbermann, the foremost German organ builder of the 
day, was endeavoring to make a "perfect" piano-forte. Undoubtedly King Frederick was 
the greatest supporter of his efforts-it is said that the King owned as many as fifteen 
Silbermann pianos! 

Bach 

Frederick was an admirer not only of pianos, but also of an organist and composer by the 
name of J. S. Bach. This Bach's compositions were somewhat notorious. Some called 
them "turgid and confused", while others claimed they were incomparable masterpieces. 
But no one disputed Bach's ability to improvise on the organ. In those days, being an 
organist not only meant being able to play, but also to extemporize, and Bach was known 
far and wide for his remarkable extemporizations. (For some delightful anecdotes about 
Bach's extemporization, see The Bach Reader, by H. T. David and A. Mendel.) 

In 1747, Bach was sixty-two, and his fame, as well as one of his sons, had reached 
Potsdam: in fact, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was the Capellmeister (choirmaster) at the 
court of King Frederick. For years the King had let it be known, through gentle hints to 
Philipp Emanuel, how

11 



pleased he would be to have the elder Bach come and pay him a visit; but this wish had 
never been realized. Frederick was particularly eager for Bach to try out his new 
Silbermann pianos, which lie (Frederick) correctly foresaw as the great new wave in 
music. 

It was Frederick's custom to have evening concerts of chamber music in his court. 
Often he himself would be the soloist in a concerto for flute Here we have reproduced a 
painting of such an evening by the German painter Adolph von Menzel, who, in the 
1800's, made a series of paintings illustrating the life of Frederick the Great. At the 
cembalo is C. P. E. Bach, and the figure furthest to the right is Joachim Quantz, the 
King's flute master-and the only person allowed to find fault with the King's flute 
playing. One May evening in 1747, an unexpected guest showed up. Johann Nikolaus 
Forkel, one of Bach's earliest biographers, tells the story 
as follows: 

One evening, just as lie was getting his flute ready, and his musicians were ssembled, 
an officer brought him a list of the strangers who had arrived. With his flute in his hand 
he ran ever the list, but immediately turned to the assembled musicians, and said, with a 
kind of agitation, "Gentlemen, old Bach is come." The Hute was now laid aside, and old 
Bach, who had alighted at his son's lodgings, was immediately summoned to the Palace. 
Wilhelm Friedemann, who accompanied his father, told me this story, and I must say 
that 1 still think with pleasure on the manner in which lie related it. At that time it was 
the fashion to make rather prolix compliments. The first appearance of J. S. Bach before 
se great a King, who did not even give him time to change his traveling dress for a 
black chanter's gown, must necessarily be attended with many apologies. I will net here 
dwell en these apologies, but merely observe, that in Wilhelm Friedemann's mouth they 
made a formal Dialogue between the King and the Apologist. 

But what is mere important than this is that the King gave up his Concert for this 
evening, and invited Bach, then already called the Old Bach, to try his fortepianos, 
made by Silbermann, which steed in several rooms of the palace. [Forkel here inserts 
this footnote: "The pianofortes manufactured by Silbermann, of Frevberg, pleased the 
King se much, that he resolved to buy them all up. He collected fifteen. I hear that they 
all now stand unfit for use in various corners of the Royal Palace."] The musicians went 
with him from room to room, and Bach was invited everywhere to try them and to play 
unpremeditated compositions. After he had gene en for some time, he asked the King to 
give him a subject for a Fugue, in order to execute it immediately without any 
preparation. The King admired the learned manner in which his subject was thus 
executed extempore: and, probably to see hew far such artt could be carried, expressed 
a wish to hear a Fugue with six Obligato parts. But as it is not every subject that is fit 
for such full harmony, Bach chose one himself, and immediately executed it to the 
astonishment of all present in the same magnificent and learned manner as he had done 
that of the King. His Majesty desired also to hear his performance en the organ. The 
next day therefore Bach was taken to all the organs in Potsdam, as lie had before been 
to Silbermann's fortepianos. After his return to Leipzig, he composed the subject, which 
he had received from the King, in three and six parts, added several artificial passages 
in strict canon to it, and had it engraved, under the title of "Musikalisches Opfer" 
[Musical Offering], and dedicated it to the Inventor.'

FIGURE 3. The Royal Theme. 



When Bach sent a copy of his Musical Offering to the King, he included a dedicatory 
letter, which is of interest for its prose style if nothing else rather submissive and 
flattersome. From a modern perspective it seems comical. Also, it probably gives 
something of the flavor of Bach's apology for his appearance. 2 

MOST GRACIOUS KING! 

In deepest humility I dedicate herewith to Your Majesty a musical offering, the 
noblest part of which derives from Your Majesty's own august hand. With awesome 
pleasure I still remember the very special Royal grace when, some time ago, during 
my visit in Potsdam, Your Majesty's Self deigned to play to me a theme for a fugue 
upon the clavier, and at the same time charged me most graciously to carry it out in 
Your Majesty's most august presence. To obey Your Majesty's command was my most 
humble dim. I noticed very soon, however, that, for lack of necessary preparation, the 
execution of the task did not fare as well as such an excellent theme demanded. I 
resoled therefore and promptly pledged myself to work out this right Royal theme 
more fully, and then make it known to the world. This resolve has now been carried 
out as well as possible, and it has none other than this irreproachable intent, to glorify, 
if only in a small point, the fame of a monarch whose greatness and power, as in all 
the sciences of war and peace, so especially in music, everyone must admire and 
revere. I make bold to add this most humble request: may Your Majesty deign to 
dignify the present modest labor with a gracious acceptance, and continue to grant 
Your Majesty's most august Royal grace to 

Your Majesty's 

most humble and obedient servant, 
THE AUTHOR 

Leipzig, July 7 1747 

Some twenty-seven years later, when Bach had been dead for twentyfour years, a Baron 
named Gottfried van Swieten-to whom, incidentally, Forkel dedicated his biography of 
Bach, and Beethoven dedicated his First Symphony-had a conversation with King 
Frederick, which he reported as follows: 

He [Frederick] spoke to me, among other things, of music, and of a great organist 
named Bach, who has been for a while in Berlin. This artist [Wilhelm Friedemann 
Bach] is endowed with a talent superior, in depth of harmonic knowledge and power 
of execution, to any 1 have heard or can imagine, while those who knew his father 
claim that he, in turn, was even greater. The King 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



14 



is of this opinion, and to prove it to me he sang aloud a chromatic fugue subject which 
he had given this old Bach, who on the spot had made of it a fugue in four parts, then 
in five parts, and finally in eight parts.' 



Of course there is no way of knowing whether it was King Frederick or Baron van 
Swieten who magnified the story into larger-than-life proportions. But it shows how 
powerful Bach's legend had become by that time. To give an idea of how extraordinary a 
six-part fugue is, in the entire Well-Tempered Clavier by Bach, containing forty-eight 
Preludes and Fugues, only two have as many as five parts, and nowhere is there a six-part 
fugue! One could probably liken the task of improvising a six-part fugue to the playing of 
sixty simultaneous blindfold games of chess, and winning them all. To improvise an 
eight-part fugue is really beyond human capability. 

In the copy which Bach sent to King Frederick, on the page preceding the first sheet of 
music, was the following inscription: 

cR^if lu£u Gn\\cUK\ic^uaGwmcaAAc^hh. 

FIG URE 4. 



("At the King's Command, the Song and the Remainder Resolved with Canonic Art.") 
Here Bach is punning on the word "canonic", since it means not only "with canons" but 
also "in the best possible way". The initials of this inscription are 



RICERC AR 



-an Italian word, meaning "to seek". And certainly there is a great deal to seek in the 
Musical Offering. It consists of one three-part fugue, one six-part fugue, ten canons, and a 
trio sonata. Musical scholars have concluded that the three-part fugue must be, in 
essence, identical with the one which Bach improvised for King Frederick. The six-part 
fugue is one of Bach's most complex creations, and its theme is, of course, the Royal 
Theme. That theme, shown in Figure 3, is a very complex one, rhythmically irregular and 
highly chromatic (that is, filled with tones which do not belong to the key it is in). To 
write a decent fugue of even two voices based on it would not be easy for the average 
musician! 

Both of the fugues are inscribed "Ricercar", rather than "Fuga". This is another 
meaning of the word; "ricercar" was, in fact, the original name for the musical form now 
known as "fugue". By Bach's time, the word "fugue" (or fuga, in Latin and Italian) had 
become standard, but the term "ricercar" had survived, and now designated an erudite 
kind of fugue, perhaps too austerely intellectual for the common ear. A similar usage 
survives in English today: the word "recherche" means, literally, "sought out", but carries 
the same kind of implication, namely of esoteric or highbrow cleverness. 

The trio sonata forms a delightful relief from the austerity of the fugues and canons, 
because it is very melodious and sweet, almost dance-

15 



able. Nevertheless, it too is based largely on the King's theme, chromatic and austere as it 
is. It is rather miraculous that Bach could use such a theme to make so pleasing an 
interlude. 

The ten canons in the Musical Offering are among the most sophisticated canons Bach 
ever wrote. However, curiously enough, Bach himself never wrote them out in full. This 
was deliberate. They were posed as puzzles to King Frederick. It was a familiar musical 
game of the day to give a single theme, together with some more or less tricky hints, and 
to let the canon based on that theme be "discovered" by someone else. In order to know 
how this is possible, you must understand a few facts about canons. 

Canons and Fugues 

The idea of a canon is that one single theme is played against itself. This is done by 
having "copies" of the theme played by the various participating voices. But there are 
means' ways to do this. The most straightforward of all canons is the round, such as 
"Three Blind Mice", "Row, Row, Row Your Boat", or " Frere Jacques". Here, the theme 
enters in the first voice and, after a fixed time-delay, a "copy" of it enters, in precisely the 
same key. After the same fixed time-delay in the second voice, the third voice enters 
carrying the theme, and so on. Most themes will not harmonize with themselves in this 
way. In order for a theme to work as a canon theme, each of its notes must be able to 
serve in a dual (or triple, or quadruple) role: it must firstly be part of a melody, and 
secondly it must be part of a harmonization of the same melody. When there are three 
canonical voices, for instance, each note of the theme must act in two distinct harmonic 
ways, as well as melodically. Thus, each note in a canon has more than one musical 
meaning; the listener's ear and brain automatically figure out the appropriate meaning, by 
referring to context. 

There are more complicated sorts of canons, of course. The first escalation in 
complexity comes when the "copies" of the theme are staggered not only in time, but also 
in pitch; thus, the first voice might sing the theme starting on C, and the second voice, 
overlapping with the first voice, might sing the identical theme starting five notes higher, 
on G. A third voice, starting on the D yet five notes higher, might overlap with the first 
two, and so on. The next escalation in complexity comes when the speeds of the different 
voices are not equal; thus, the second voice might sing twice as quickly, or twice as 
slowly, as the first voice. The former is called diminution, the latter augmentation (since 
the theme seems to shrink or to expand). 

We are not yet done! The next stage of complexity in canon construction is to invert the 
theme, which means to make a melody which jumps down wherever the original theme 
jumps up, and by exactly the same number of semitones. This is a rather weird melodic 
transformation, but when one has heard many themes inverted, it begins to seem quite 
natural. Bach was especially fond of inversions, and they show up often in his work-and 
the Musical Offering is no exception. (For a simple example of 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



16 



inversion, try the tune "Good King Wenceslas". When the original and its inversion are 
sung together, starting an octave apart and staggered with a time-delay of two beats, a 
pleasing canon results.) Finally, the most esoteric of "copies" is the retrograde copy- 
where the theme is played backwards in time. A canon which uses this trick is 
affectionately known as a crab canon, because of the peculiarities of crab locomotion. 
Bach included a crab canon in the Musical Offering, needless to say. Notice that every 
type of "copy" preserves all the information in the original theme, in the sense that the 
theme is fully recoverable from any of the copies. Such an information preserving 
transformation is often called an isomorphism, and we will have much traffic with 
isomorphisms in this book. 

Sometimes it is desirable to relax the tightness of the canon form. One way is to allow 
slight departures from perfect copying, for the sake of more fluid harmony. Also, some 
canons have "free" voices-voices which do not employ the canon's theme, but which 
simply harmonize agreeably with the voices that are in canon with each other. 

Each of the canons in the Musical Offering has for its theme a different variant of the 
King's Theme, and all the devices described above for making canons intricate are 
exploited to the hilt; in fact, they are occasionally combined. Thus, one three-voice canon 
is labeled "Canon per Augmentationem, contrario Motu"; its middle voice is free (in fact, 
it sings the Royal Theme), while the other two dance canonically above and below it, 
using the devices of augmentation and inversion. Another bears simply the cryptic label 
"Quaerendo invenietis" ("By seeking, you will discover"). All of the canon puzzles have 
been solved. The canonical solutions were given by one of Bach's pupils, Johann Philipp 
Kirnberger. But one might still wonder whether there are more solutions to seek! 

I should also explain briefly what a fugue is. A fugue is like a canon, in that it is 
usually based on one theme which gets played in different voices and different keys, and 
occasionally at different speeds or upside down or backwards. However, the notion of 
fugue is much less rigid than that of canon, and consequently it allows for more 
emotional and artistic expression. The telltale sign of a fugue is the way it begins: with a 
single voice singing its theme. When it is done, then a second voice enters, either five 
scale-notes up, or four down. Meanwhile the first voice goes on, singing the 
"countersubject": a secondary theme, chosen to provide rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic 
contrasts to the subject. Each of the voices enters in turn, singing the theme, often to the 
accompaniment of the countersubject in some other voice, with the remaining voices 
doing whatever fanciful things entered the composer's mind. When all the voices have 
"arrived", then there are no rules. There are, to be sure, standard kinds of things to do-but 
not so standard that one can merely compose a fugue by formula. The two fugues in the 
Musical Offering are outstanding examples of fugues that could never have been 
"composed by formula". There is something much deeper in them than mere fugality. 

All in all, the Musical Offering represents one of Bach's supreme accomplishments in 
counterpoint. It is itself one large intellectual fugue, in

which many ideas and forms have been woven together, and in which playful double 
meanings and subtle allusions are commonplace. And it is a very beautiful creation of the 
human intellect which we can appreciate forever. (The entire work is wonderfully 
described in the book f. S. Bach's Musical Offering, by H. T. David.) 

An Endlessly Rising Canon 

There is one canon in the Musical Offering which is particularly unusual. Labeled simply 
"Canon per Tonos", it has three voices. The uppermost voice sings a variant of the Royal 
Theme, while underneath it, two voices provide a canonic harmonization based on a 
second theme. The lower of this pair sings its theme in C minor (which is the key of the 
canon as a whole), and the upper of the pair sings the same theme displaced upwards in 
pitch by an interval of a fifth. What makes this canon different from any other, however, 
is that when it concludes-or, rather, seems to conclude-it is no longer in the key of C 
minor, but now is in D minor. Somehow Bach has contrived to modulate (change keys) 
right under the listener's nose. And it is so constructed that this "ending" ties smoothly 
onto the beginning again; thus one can repeat the process and return in the key of E, only 
to join again to the beginning. These successive modulations lead the ear to increasingly 
remote provinces of tonality, so that after several of them, one would expect to be 
hopelessly far away from the starting key. And yet magically, after exactly six such 
modulations, the original key of C minor has been restored! All the voices are exactly one 
octave higher than they were at the beginning, and here the piece may be broken off in a 
musically agreeable way. Such, one imagines, was Bach's intention; but Bach indubitably 
also relished the implication that this process could go on ad infinitum, which is perhaps 
why he wrote in the margin "As the modulation rises, so may the King's Glory." To 
emphasize its potentially infinite aspect, I like to call this the "Endlessly Rising Canon". 

In this canon, Bach has given us our first example of the notion of Strange Loops. The 
"Strange Loop" phenomenon occurs whenever, by moving upwards (or downwards) 
through the levels of some hierarchical system, we unexpectedly find ourselves right 
back where we started. (Here, the system is that of musical keys.) Sometimes I use the 
term Tangled Hierarchy to describe a system in which a Strange Loop occurs. As we go 
on, the theme of Strange Loops will recur again and again. Sometimes it will be hidden, 
other times it will be out in the open; sometimes it will be right side up, other times it will 
be upside down, or backwards. "Quaerendo invenietis" is my advice to the reader. 

Escher 

To my mind, the most beautiful and powerful visual realizations of this notion of Strange 
Loops exist in the work of the Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher, who lived from 1902 to 
1972. Escher was the creator of some of the

18 



FIGURE 5. Waterfall, by M. C. Escher (lithograph, 1961). 



most intellectually stimulating drawings of all time. Many of them have their origin in 
paradox, illusion, or double-meaning. Mathematicians were among the first admirers of 
Escher's drawings, and this is understandable because they often are based on 
mathematical principles of symmetry or pattern ... But there is much more to a typical 
Escher drawing than just symmetry or pattern; there is often an underlying idea, realized 
in artistic form. And in particular, the Strange Loop is one of the most recurrent themes in 
Escher's work. Look, for example, at the lithograph Waterfall (Fig. 5), and compare its 
six-step endlessly falling loop with the six-step endlessly rising loop of the "Canon per 
Tonos". The similarity of vision is

remarkable. Bach and Escher are playing one single theme in two different "keys": music 
and art. 

Escher realized Strange Loops in several different ways, and they can be arranged 
according to the tightness of the loop. The lithograph Ascending and Descending (Fig. 6), 
in which monks trudge forever in loops, is the loosest version, since it involves so many 
steps before the starting point is regained. A tighter loop is contained in Waterfall, which, 
as we already observed, involves only six discrete steps. You may be thinking that there 
is some ambiguity in the notion of a single "step"-for instance, couldn't Ascending and 
Descending be seen just as easily as having four levels (staircases) as forty-five levels 
(stairs) % It is indeed true that there is an inherent

haziness in level-counting, not only in Escher pictures, but in hierarchical, many-level 
systems. We will sharpen our understanding of this haziness later on. But let us not get 
too distracted now' As we tighten our loop, we come to the remarkable Drawing Hands 
(Fig. 135), in which each of two hands draws the other: a two-step Strange Loop. And 
finally, the tightest of all Strange Loops is realized in Print Gallery (Fig. 142): a picture 
of a picture which contains itself. Or is it a picture of a gallery which contains itself? Or 
of a town which contains itself? Or a young man who contains himself? (Incidentally, the 
illusion underlying Ascending and Descending and Waterfall was not invented by Escher, 
but by Roger Penrose, a British mathematician, in 1958. However, the theme of the 
Strange Loop was already present in Escher's work in 1948, the year he drew Drawing 
Hands. Print Gallery dates from 1956.) 

Implicit in the concept of Strange Loops is the concept of infinity, since what else is a 
loop but a way of representing an endless process in a finite way? And infinity plays a 
large role n many of Escher's drawings. Copies of one single theme often fit into each' 
other, forming visual analogues to the canons of Bach. Several such patterns can be seen 
in Escher's famous print Metamorphosis (Fig. 8). It is a little like the "Endlessly Rising 
Canon": wandering further and further from its starting point, it suddenly is back. In the 
tiled planes of Metamorphosis and other pictures, there are already suggestions of 
infinity. But wilder visions of infinity appear in other drawings by Escher. In some of his 
drawings, one single theme can appear on different levels of reality. For instance, one 
level in a drawing might clearly be recognizable as representing fantasy or imagination; 
another level would be recognizable as reality. These two levels might be the only 
explicitly portrayed levels. But the mere presence of these two levels invites the viewer to 
look upon himself as part of yet another level; and by taking that step, the viewer cannot 
help getting caught up in Escher's implied chain of levels, in which, for any one level, 
there is always another level above it of greater "reality", and likewise, there is always a 
level below, "more imaginary" than it is. This can be mind-boggling in itself. However, 
what happens if the chain of levels is not linear, but forms a loop? What is real, then, and 
what is fantasy? The genius of Escher was that he could not only concoct, but actually 
portray, dozens of half-real, half-mythical worlds, worlds filled with Strange Loops, 
which he seems to be inviting his viewers to enter. 

Godel 

In the examples we have seen of Strange Loops by Bach and Escher, there is a conflict 
between the finite and the infinite, and hence a strong sense of paradox. Intuition senses 
that there is something mathematical involved here. And indeed in our own century a 
mathematical counterpart was discovered, with the most enormous repercussions. And, 
just as the Bach and Escher loops appeal to very simple and ancient intuitions-a musical 
scale, a staircase-so this discovery, by K. Godel, of a Strange Loop in 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



23 



FIGURE 9. Kurt Godel. 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



mathematical systems has its origins in simple and ancient intuitions. In its absolutely 
barest form, Godel's discovery involves the translation of an ancient paradox in 
philosophy into mathematical terms. That paradox is the so-called Epimenides paradox, 
or liar paradox. Epimenides was a Cretan who made one immortal statement: "All 
Cretans are liars." A sharper version of the statement is simply "I am lying"; or, "This 
statement is false". It is that last version which I will usually mean when I speak of the 
Epimenides paradox. It is a statement which rudely violates the usually assumed 
dichotomy of statements into true and false, because if you tentatively think it is true, 
then it immediately backfires on you and makes you think it is false. But once you've 
decided it is false, a similar backfiring returns you to the idea that it must be true. Try it! 

The Epimenides paradox is a one-step Strange Loop, like Escher's Print Gallery. But 
how does it have to do with mathematics? That is what Godel discovered. His idea was to 
use mathematical reasoning in exploring mathematical reasoning itself. This notion of 
making mathematics "introspective" proved to be enormously powerful, and perhaps its 
richest implication was the one Godel found: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. What the 
Theorem states and how it is proved are two different things. We shall discuss both in 
quite some detail in this book. The Theorem can De likened to a pearl, and the method of 
proof to an oyster. The pearl is prized for its luster and simplicity; the oyster is a complex 
living beast whose innards give rise to this mysteriously simple gem. 

Godel's Theorem appears as Proposition VI in his 1931 paper "On Formally 
Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I." It states: 

To every w-consistent recursive class K of formulae there correspond recursive 
class-signs r, such that neither v Gen r nor Neg (v Gen r) belongs to Fig (K) (where v 
is the free variable of r). 

Actually, it was in German, and perhaps you feel that it might as well be in German 
anyway. So here is a paraphrase in more normal English: 

All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory 
include undecidable propositions. 

This is the pearl. 

In this pearl it is hard to see a Strange Loop. That is because the Strange Loop is buried 
in the oyster-the proof. The proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem hinges upon the 
writing of a self-referential mathematical statement, in the same way as the Epimenides 
paradox is a self-referential statement of language. But whereas it is very simple to talk 
about language in language, it is not at all easy to see how a statement about numbers can 
talk about itself. In fact, it took genius merely to connect the idea of self-referential 
statements with number theory. Once Godel had the intuition that such a statement could 
be created, he was over the major hurdle. The actual creation of the statement was the 
working out of this one beautiful spark of intuition. 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



25 



We shall examine the Godel construction quite carefully in Chapters to come, but so that 
you are not left completely in the dark, I will sketch here, in a few strokes, the core of the 
idea, hoping that what you see will trigger ideas in your mind. First of all, the difficulty 
should be made absolutely clear. Mathematical statements-let us concentrate on number- 
theoretical ones-are about properties of whole numbers. Whole numbers are not 
statements, nor are their properties. A statement of number theory is not about a. 
statement of number theory; it just is a statement of number theory. This is the problem; 
but Godel realized that there was more here than meets the eye. 

Godel had the insight that a statement of number theory could be about a statement of 
number theory (possibly even itself), if only numbers could somehow stand for 
statements. The idea of a code, in other words, is at the heart of his construction. In the 
Godel Code, usually called "Godel-numbering", numbers are made to stand for symbols 
and sequences of symbols. That way, each statement of number theory, being a sequence 
of specialized symbols, acquires a Godel number, something like a telephone number or a 
license plate, by which it can be referred to. And this coding trick enables statements of 
number theory to be understood on two different levels: as statements of number theory, 
and also as statements about statements of number theory. 

Once Godel had invented this coding scheme, he had to work out in detail a way of 
transporting the Epimenides paradox into a numbertheoretical formalism. His final 
transplant of Epimenides did not say, "This statement of number theory is false", but 
rather, "This statement of number theory does not have any proof. A great deal of 
confusion can be caused by this, because people generally understand the notion of 
"proof rather vaguely. In fact, Godel's work was just part of a long attempt by 
mathematicians to explicate for themselves what proofs are. The important thing to keep 
in mind is that proofs are demonstrations within fixed systems of propositions. In the case 
of Godel's work, the fixed system of numbertheoretical reasoning to which the word 
"proof refers is that of Principia Mathematica (P.M.), a giant opus by Bertrand Russell 
and Alfred North Whitehead, published between 1910 and 1913. Therefore, the Godel 
sentence G should more properly be written in English as: 

This statement of number theory does not have any proof in the system of Principia 
Mathematica. 

Incidentally, this Godel sentence G is not Godel's Theorem-no more than the Epimenides 
sentence is the observation that "The Epimenides sentence is a paradox." We can now 
state what the effect of discovering G is. Whereas the Epimenides statement creates a 
paradox since it is neither true nor false, the Godel sentence G is unprovable (inside 
P.M.) but true. The grand conclusion% That the system of Principia Mathematica is 
"incomplete"-there are true statements of number theory which its methods of proof are 
too weak to demonstrate. 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



26 



But if Principia Mathematica was the first victim of this stroke, it was certainly not the 
last! The phrase "and Related Systems" in the title of Godel's article is a telling one: for if 
Godel's result had merely pointed out a defect in the work of Russell and Whitehead, then 
others could have been inspired to improve upon P.M. and to outwit Godel's Theorem. 
But this was not possible: Godel's proof pertained to any axiomatic system which 
purported to achieve the aims which Whitehead and Russell had set for themselves. And 
for each different system, one basic method did the trick. In short, Godel showed that 
provability is a weaker notion than truth, no matter what axiomatic system is involved. 

Therefore Godel's Theorem had an electrifying effect upon logicians, mathematicians, 
and philosophers interested in the foundations of mathematics, for it showed that no fixed 
system, no matter how complicated, could represent the complexity of the whole 
numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... Modern readers may not be as nonplussed by this as readers of 
1931 were, since in the interim our culture has absorbed Godel's Theorem, along with the 
conceptual revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics, and their philosophically 
disorienting messages have reached the public, even if cushioned by several layers of 
translation (and usually obfuscation). There is a general mood of expectation, these days, 
of "limitative" results-but back in 1931, this came as a bolt from the blue. 

Mathematical Logic: A Synopsis 

A proper appreciation of Godel's Theorem requires a setting of context. Therefore, I will 
now attempt to summarize in a short space the history of mathematical logic prior to 
1931 -an impossible task. (See DeLong, Kneebone, or Nagel and Newman, for good 
presentations of history.) It all began with the attempts to mechanize the thought 
processes of reasoning. Now our ability to reason has often been claimed to be what 
distinguishes us from other species; so it seems somewhat paradoxical, on first thought, 
to mechanize that which is most human. Yet even the ancient Greeks knew that reasoning 
is a patterned process, and is at least partially governed by statable laws. Aristotle 
codified syllogisms, and Euclid codified geometry; but thereafter, many centuries had to 
pass before progress in the study of axiomatic reasoning would take place again. 

One of the significant discoveries of nineteenth-century mathematics was that there are 
different, and equally valid, geometries- where by "a geometry" is meant a theory of 
properties of abstract points and lines. It had long been assumed that geometry was what 
Euclid had codified, and that, although there might be small flaws in Euclid's 
presentation, they were unimportant and any real progress in geometry would be 
achieved by extending Euclid. This idea was shattered by the roughly simultaneous 
discovery of non-Euclidean geometry by several people-a discovery that shocked the 
mathematics community, because it deeply challenged the idea that mathematics studies 
the real world. How could there be many differ 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



27 



ent kinds of "points" and "lines" in one single reality? Today, the solution to the dilemma 
may be apparent, even to some nonmathematicians-but at the time, the dilemma created 
havoc in mathematical circles. 

Later in the nineteenth century, the English logicians George Boole and Augustus De 
Morgan went considerably further than Aristotle in codifying strictly deductive reasoning 
patterns. Boole even called his book "The Laws of Thoughf'-surely an exaggeration, but 
it was an important contribution. Lewis Carroll was fascinated by these mechanized 
reasoning methods, and invented many puzzles which could be solved with them. Gottlob 
Frege in Jena and Giuseppe Peano in Turin worked on combining formal reasoning with 
the study of sets and numbers. David Hilbert in Gottingen worked on stricter 
formalizations of geometry than Euclid's. All of these efforts were directed towards 
clarifying what one means by "proof. 

In the meantime, interesting developments were taking place in classical mathematics. 
A theory of different types of infinities, known as the theory of sets, was developed by 
Georg Cantor in the 1880's. The theory was powerful and beautiful, but intuition-defying. 
Before long, a variety of set-theoretical paradoxes had been unearthed. The situation was 
very disturbing, because just as mathematics seemed to be recovering from one set of 
paradoxes-those related to the theory of limits, in the calculusalong came a whole new 
set, which looked worse! 

The most famous is Russell's paradox. Most sets, it would seem, are not members of 
themselves-for example, the set of walruses is not a walrus, the set containing only Joan 
of Arc is not Joan of Arc (a set is not a person)-and so on. In this respect, most sets are 
rather "run-of-the-mill". However, some "self-swallowing" sets do contain themselves as 
members, such as the set of all sets, or the set of all things except Joan of Arc, and so on. 
Clearly, every set is either run-of-the-mill or self-swallowing, and no set can be both. 
Now nothing prevents us from inventing R: the set of all run-o,-the-mill sets. At first, R 
might seem a rather run-of-the-mill invention-but that opinion must be revised when you 
ask yourself, "Is R itself "a run-of-the-mill set or a self-swallowing set?" You will find 
that the answer is: "R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, for either choice 
leads to paradox." Try it! 

But if R is neither run-of-the-mill nor self-swallowing, then what is it? At the very 
least, pathological. But no one was satisfied with evasive answers of that sort. And so 
people began to dig more deeply into the foundations of set theory. The crucial questions 
seemed to be: "What is wrong with our intuitive concept of 'set'? Can we make a rigorous 
theory of sets which corresponds closely with our intuitions, but which skirts the 
paradoxes?" Here, as in number theory and geometry, the problem is in trying to line up 
intuition with formalized, or axiomatized, reasoning systems. 

A startling variant of Russell's paradox, called "Grelling's paradox", can be made using 
adjectives instead of sets. Divide the adjectives in English into two categories: those 
which are self-descriptive, such as "pentasyllable", "awkwardnessful", and "recherche", 
and those which are not, such 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



28 



as "edible", "incomplete", and "bisyllabic". Now if we admit "non-selfdescriptive" as an 
adjective, to which class does it belong? If it seems questionable to include hyphenated 
words, we can use two terms invented specially for this paradox: autological (= "self- 
descriptive"), and heterological (= "non-self-descriptive"). The question then becomes: 
"Is 'heterological' heterological?" Try it! 

There seems to he one common culprit in these paradoxes, namely self-reference, or 
"Strange Loopiness". So if the goal is to ban all paradoxes, why not try banning self- 
reference and anything that allows it to arise? This is not so easy as it might seem, 
because it can be hard to figure out just where self-reference is occurring. It may be 
spread out over a whole Strange Loop with several steps, as in this "expanded" version of 
Epimenides, reminiscent of Drawing Hands: 

The following sentence is false. 
The preceding sentence is true. 

Taken together, these sentences have the same effect as the original Epimenides paradox: 
yet separately, they are harmless and even potentially useful sentences. The "blame" for 
this Strange Loop can't he pinned on either sentence-only on the way they "point" at each 
other. In the same way, each local region of Ascending and Descending is quite 
legitimate; it is only the way they are globally put together that creates an impossibility. 
Since there are indirect as well as direct ways of achieving self-reference, one must figure 
out how to ban both types at once-if one sees selfreference as the root of all evil. 
Banishing Strange Loops 

Russell and Whitehead did subscribe to this view, and accordingly, Principia 
Mathematica was a mammoth exercise in exorcising Strange Loops from logic, set 
theory, and number theory. The idea of their system was basically this. A set of the 
lowest "type" could contain only "objects" as membersnot sets. A set of the next type up 
could only contain objects, or sets of the lowest type. In general, a set of a given type 
could only contain sets of lower type, or objects. Every set would belong to a specific 
type. Clearly, no set could contain itself because it would have to belong to a type higher 
than its own type. Only "run-of-the-mill" sets exist in such a system; furthermore, old li- 
the set of all run-of-the-mill sets-no longer is considered a set at all, because it does not 
belong to any finite type. To all appearances, then, this theory of types, which we might 
also call the "theory of the abolition of Strange Loops", successfully rids set theory of its 
paradoxes, but only at the cost of introducing an artificial-seeming hierarchy, and of 
disallowing the formation of certain kinds of sets-such as the set of all run-of-the-mill 
sets. Intuitively, this is not the way we imagine sets. 

The theory of types handled Russell's paradox, but it did nothing about the Epimenides 
paradox or Grelling's paradox. For people whose 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



29 



interest went no further than set theory, this was quite adequate -but for people interested 
in the elimination of paradoxes generally, some similar "hierarchization" seemed 
necessary, to forbid looping back inside language. At the bottom of such a hierarchy 
would be an object language. Here, reference could be made only to a specific domain- 
not to aspects of the object language itself (such as its grammatical rules, or specific 
sentences in it). For that purpose there would be a metalanguage. This experience of two 
linguistic levels is familiar to all learners of foreign languages. Then there would be a 
metametalanguage for discussing the metalanguage, and so on. It would be required that 
every sentence should belong to some precise level of the hierarchy. Therefore, if one 
could find no level in which a given utterance fit, then the utterance would be deemed 
meaningless, and forgotten. 

An analysis can be attempted on the two-step Epimenides loop given above. The first 
sentence, since it speaks of the second, must be on a higher level than the second. But by 
the same token, the second sentence must be on a higher level than the first. Since this is 
impossible, the two sentences are "meaningless". More precisely, such sentences simply 
cannot be formulated at all in a system based on a strict hierarchy of languages. This 
prevents all versions of the Epimenides paradox as well as Grelling's paradox. (To what 
language level could "heterological" belong?) 

Now in set theory, which deals with abstractions that we don't use all the time, a 
stratification like the theory of types seems acceptable, even if a little strange-but when it 
comes to language, an all-pervading part of life, such stratification appears absurd. We 
don't think of ourselves as jumping up and down a hierarchy of languages when we speak 
about various things. A rather matter-of-fact sentence such as, "In this book, I criticize 
the theory of types" would be doubly forbidden in the system we are discussing. Firstly, it 
mentions "this book", which should only be mentionable in a 

metabook"-and secondly, it mentions me-a person whom I should not be allowed to 
speak of at all! This example points out how silly the theory of types seems, when you 
import it into a familiar context. The remedy it adopts for paradoxes-total banishment of 
self-reference in any form-is a real case of overkill, branding many perfectly good 
constructions as meaningless. The adjective "meaningless", by the way, would have to 
apply to all discussions of the theory of linguistic types (such as that of this very 
paragraph) for they clearly could not occur on any of the levels-neither object language, 
nor metalanguage, nor metametalanguage, etc. So the very act of discussing the theory 
would be the most blatant possible violation of it! 

Now one could defend such theories by saying that they were only intended to deal 
with formal languages-not with ordinary, informal language. This may be so, but then it 
shows that such theories are extremely academic and have little to say about paradoxes 
except when they crop up in special tailor-made systems. Besides, the drive to eliminate 
paradoxes at any cost, especially when it requires the creation of highly artificial 
formalisms, puts too much stress on bland consistency, and too little on the

quirky and bizarre, which make life and mathematics interesting. It is of course important 
to try to maintain consistency, but when this effort forces you into a stupendously ugly 
theory, you know something is wrong. 

These types of issues in the foundations of mathematics were responsible for the high 
interest in codifying human reasoning methods which was present in the early part of this 
century. Mathematicians and philosophers had begun to have serious doubts about 
whether even the most concrete of theories, such as the study of whole numbers (number 
theory), were built on solid foundations. If paradoxes could pop up so easily in set 
theory-a theory whose basic concept, that of a set, is surely very intuitively appealing- 
then might they not also exist in other branches of mathematics? Another related worry 
was that the paradoxes of logic, such as the Epimenides paradox, might turn out to be 
internal to mathematics, and thereby cast in doubt all of mathematics. This was especially 
worrisome to those-and there were a good number-who firmly believed that mathematics 
is simply a branch of logic (or conversely, that logic is simply a branch of mathematics). 
In fact, this very question-" Are mathematics and logic distinct, or separate%"-was the 
source of much controversy. 

This study of mathematics itself became known as metamathematics-or occasionally, 
metalogic, since mathematics and logic are so intertwined. The most urgent priority of 
metamathematicians was to determine the true nature of mathematical reasoning. What is 
a legal method of procedure, and what is an illegal one? Since mathematical reasoning 
had always been done in "natural language" (e.g., French or Latin or some language for 
normal communication), there was always a lot of possible ambiguity. Words had 
different meanings to different people, conjured up different images, and so forth. It 
seemed reasonable and even important to establish a single uniform notation in which all 
mathematical work could be done, and with the aid of which any two mathematicians 
could resolve disputes over whether a suggested proof was valid or not. This would 
require a complete codification of the universally acceptable modes of human reasoning, 
at least as far as they applied to mathematics. 

Consistency, Completeness, Hilbert's Program 

This was the goal of Principia Mathematica, which purported to derive all of mathematics 
from logic, and, to be sure, without contradictions! It was widely admired, but no one 
was sure if (1) all of mathematics really was contained in the methods delineated by 
Russell and Whitehead, or (2) the methods given were even self-consistent. Was it 
absolutely clear that contradictory results could never be derived, by any mathematicians 
whatsoever, following the methods of Russell and Whitehead? 

This question particularly bothered the distinguished German mathematician (and 
metamathematician) David Hilbert, who set before the world community of 
mathematicians (and metamathematicians) this chal

31 



lenge: to demonstrate rigorously-perhaps following the very methods outlined by Russell 
and Whitehead-that the system defined in Principia Mathematica was both consistent 
(contradiction-free), and complete (i.e., that every true statement of, number theory could 
be derived within the framework drawn up in P.M.). This was a tall order, and one could 
criticize it on the grounds that it was somewhat circular: how can you justify your 
methods of reasoning on the basis of those same methods of reasoning? It is like lifting 
yourself up by your own bootstraps. (We just don't seem to be able to get away from 
these Strange Loops!) 

Hilbert was fully aware of this dilemma, of course, and therefore expressed the hope 
that a demonstration of consistency or completeness could be found which depended only 
on "finitistic" modes of reasoning, "these were a small set of reasoning methods usually 
accepted by mathematicians. In this way, Hilbert hoped that mathematicians could 
partially lift themselves by their own bootstraps: the sum total of mathematical methods 
might be proved sound, by invoking only a smaller set of methods. This goal may sound 
rather esoteric, but it occupied the minds of many of the greatest mathematicians in the 
world during the first thirty years of this century. 

In the thirty-first year, however, Godel published his paper, which in some ways 
utterly demolished Hilbert's program. This paper revealed not only that there were 
irreparable "holes" in the axiomatic system proposed by Russell and Whitehead, but more 
generally, that no axiomatic system whatsoever could produce all number-theoretical 
truths, unless it were an inconsistent system! And finally, the hope of proving the 
consistency of a system such as that presented in P.M. was shown to be vain: if such a 
proof could be found using only methods inside P.M., then-and this is one of the most 
mystifying consequences of Godel's work-P.M. itself would be inconsistent! 

The final irony of it all is that the proof of Gi del's Incompleteness Theorem involved 
importing the Epimenides paradox right into the heart ofPrincipia Mathematica, a bastion 
supposedly invulnerable to the attacks of Strange Loops! Although Godel's Strange Loop 
did not destroy Principia Mathematica, it made it far less interesting to mathematicians, 
for it showed that Russell and Whitehead's original aims were illusory. 

Babbage, Computers, Artificial Intelligence ... 

When Godel's paper came out, the world was on the brink of developing electronic digital 
computers. Now the idea of mechanical calculating engines had been around for a while. 
In the seventeenth century, Pascal and Leibniz designed machines to perform fixed 
operations (addition and multiplication). These machines had no memory, however, and 
were not, in modern parlance, programmable. 

The first human to conceive of the immense computing potential of machinery was the 
Londoner Charles Babbage (1792-1871). A character who could almost have stepped out 
of the pages of the Pickwick Papers, 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



32 



Babbage was most famous during his lifetime for his vigorous campaign to rid London 
of "street nuisances" -organ grinders above all. These pests, loving to get his goat, would 
come and serenade him at any time of day or night, and he would furiously chase them 
down the street. Today, we recognize in Babbage a man a hundred years ahead of his 
time: not only inventor of the basic principles of modern computers, he was also one of 
the first to battle noise pollution. 

His first machine, the "Difference Engine", could generate mathematical tables of 
many kinds by the "method of differences". But before any model of the "D.E." had been 
built, Babbage became obsessed with a much more revolutionary idea: his "Analytical 
Engine". Rather immodestly, he wrote, "The course through which I arrived at it was the 
most entangled and perplexed which probably ever occupied the human mind.'" Unlike 
any previously designed machine, the A.E. was to possess both a "store" (memory) and a 
"mill" (calculating and decision-making unit). These units were to be built of thousands 
of intricate geared cylinders interlocked in incredibly complex ways. Babbage had a 
vision of numbers swirling in and out of the mill tinder control of a program contained in 
punched cards-an idea inspired by the jacquard loom, a card-controlled loom that wove 
amazingly complex patterns. Babbage's brilliant but ill-fated Countess friend, Lady Ada 
Lovelace (daughter of Lord Byron), poetically commented that "the Analytical Engine 
weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves." 
Unfortunately, her use of the present tense was misleading, for no A.E. was ever built, 
and Babbage died a bitterly disappointed man. 

Lady Lovelace, no less than Babbage, was profoundly aware that with the invention of 
the Analytical Engine, mankind was flirting with mechanized intelligence-particularly if 
the Engine were capable of "eating its own tail" (the way Babbage described the Strange 
Loop created when a machine reaches in and alters its own stored program). In an 1842 
memoir,5 she wrote that the A.E. "might act upon other things besides number". While 
Babbage dreamt of creating_ a chess or tic-tac-toe automaton, she suggested that his 
Engine, with pitches and harmonies coded into its spinning cylinders, "might compose 
elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent." In nearly 
the same breath, however, she cautions that "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions 
whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform." 
Though she well understood the power of artificial computation, Lady Lovelace was 
skeptical about the artificial creation of intelligence. However, could her keen insight 
allow her to dream of the potential that would be opened up with the taming of 
electricity? 

In our century the time was ripe for computers-computers beyond the wildest dreams of 
Pascal, Leibniz, Babbage, or Lady Lovelace. In the 1930's and 1940's, the first "giant 
electronic brains" were designed and built. They catalyzed the convergence of three 
previously disparate areas: the theory of axiomatic reasoning, the study of mechanical 
computation, and the psychology of intelligence. 
These same years saw the theory of computers develop by leaps and 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



33 



bounds. This theory was tightly linked to metamathematics. In fact, Godel's Theorem has 
a counterpart in the theory of computation, discovered by Alan Turing, which reveals the 
existence of inelucPable "holes" in even the most powerful computer imaginable. 
Ironically, just as these somewhat eerie limits were being mapped out, real computers 
were being built whose powers seemed to grow and grow beyond their makers' power of 
prophecy. Babbage, who once declared he would gladly give up the rest of his life if he 
could come back in five hundred years and have a three-day guided scientific tour of the 
new age, would probably have been thrilled speechless a mere century after his death- 
both by the new machines, and by their unexpected limitations. 

By the early 1950's, mechanized intelligence seemed a mere stone's throw away; and 
yet, for each barrier crossed, there always cropped up some new barrier to the actual 
creation of a genuine thinking machine. Was there some deep reason for this goal's 
mysterious recession? 

No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent 
behavior lies; in fact, to suggest that a sharp borderline exists is probably silly. But 
essential abilities for intelligence are certainly: 

to respond to situations very flexibly; 

to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances; 

to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages; 

to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a 

situation; 

to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them; 
to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities may link them; 
to synthesize new concepts by taking old them together in new ways; to come up 
with ideas which are novel. 

Here one runs up against a seeming paradox. Computers by their very nature are the 
most inflexible, desireless, rule-following of beasts. Fast though they may be, they are 
nonetheless the epitome of unconsciousness. How, then, can intelligent behavior be 
programmed? Isn't this the most blatant of contradictions in terms? One of the major 
theses of this book is that it is not a contradiction at all. One of the major purposes of this 
book is to urge each reader to confront the apparent contradiction head on, to savor it, to 
turn it over, to take it apart, to wallow in it, so that in the end the reader might emerge 
with new insights into the seemingly unbreathable gulf between the formal and the 
informal, the animate and the inanimate, the flexible and the inflexible. 

This is what Artificial Intelligence (Al) research is all about. And the strange flavor of 
AI work is that people try to put together long sets of rules in strict formalisms which tell 
inflexible machines how to be flexible. 

What sorts of "rules" could possibly capture all of what we think of as intelligent 
behavior, however? Certainly there must be rules on all sorts of 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



34 



different levels. There must be many "just plain" rules. There must be "metarules" to 
modify the "just plain" rules; then "metametarules" to modify the metarules, and so on. 
The flexibility of intelligence comes from the enormous number of different rules, and 
levels of rules. The reason that so many rules on so many different levels must exist is 
that in life, a creature is faced with millions of situations of completely different types. In 
some situations, there are stereotyped responses which require "just plain" rules. Some 
situations are mixtures of stereotyped situations-thus they require rules for deciding 
which of the just plain" rules to apply. Some situations cannot be classified-thus there 
must exist rules for inventing new rules ... and on and on. Without doubt, Strange Loops 
involving rules that change themselves, directly or indirectly, are at the core of 
intelligence. Sometimes the complexity of our minds seems so overwhelming that one 
feels that there can be no solution to the problem of understanding intelligence-that it is 
wrong to think that rules of any sort govern a creature's behavior, even if one takes "rule" 
in the multilevel sense described above. 

...and Bach 

In the year 1754, four years after the death of J. S. Bach, the Leipzig theologian Johann 
Michael Schmidt wrote, in a treatise on music and the soul, the following noteworthy 
passage: 

Not many years ago it was reported from France that a man had made a statue that 
could play various pieces on the Fleuttraversiere, placed the flute to its lips and took it 
down again, rolled its eyes, etc. But no one has yet invented an image that thinks, or 
wills, or composes, or even does anything at all similar. Let anyone who wishes to be 
convinced look carefully at the last fugal work of the above-praised Bach, which has 
appeared in copper engraving, but which was left unfinished because his blindness 
intervened, and let him observe the art that is contained therein; or what must strike 
him as even more wonderful, the Chorale which he dictated in his blindness to the pen 
of another: Wenn wir in hochsten Nothen seen. I am sure that he will soon need his 
soul if he wishes to observe all the beauties contained therein, let alone wishes to play 
it to himself or to form a judgment of the author. Everything that the 
champions of Materialism put forward must fall to the ground in view of this 
single example. 6 

Quite likely, the foremost of the "champions of Materialism" here alluded to was none 
other than Julien Offroy de la Mettrie-philosopher at the court of Frederick the Great, 
author of L'homme machine ("Man, the Machine"), and Materialist Par Excellence. It is 
now more than 200 years later, and the battle is still raging between those who agree with 
Johann Michael Schmidt, and those who agree with Julien Offroy de la Mettrie. I hope in 
this book to give some perspective on the battle. 

"Godel, Escher, Bach" 

The book is structured in an unusual way: as a counterpoint between Dialogues and 
Chapters. The purpose of this structure is to allow me to 



Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering 



35 



present new concepts twice: almost every new concept is first presented metaphorically 
in a Dialogue, yielding a set of concrete, visual images; then these serve, during the 
reading of the following' Chapter, as an intuitive background for a more serious and 
abstract presentation of the same concept. In many of the Dialogues I appear to be talking 
about one idea on the surface, but in reality I am talking about some other idea, in a thinly 
disguised way. 

Originally, the only characters in my Dialogues were Achilles and the Tortoise, who 
came to me from Zeno of Elea, by way of Lewis Carroll. Zeno of Elea, inventor of 
paradoxes, lived in the fifth century B.C. One of his paradoxes was an allegory, with 
Achilles and the Tortoise as protagonists. Zeno's invention of the happy pair is told in my 
first Dialogue, Three-Part Invention. In 1895, Lewis Carroll reincarnated Achilles and the 
Tortoise for the purpose of illustrating his own new paradox of infinity. Carroll's paradox, 
which deserves to be far better known than it is, plays a significant role in this book. 
Originally titled "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles", it is reprinted here as Two-Part 
Invention. 

When I began writing Dialogues, somehow I connected them up with musical forms. I 
don't remember the moment it happened; I just remember one day writing "Fugue" above 
an early Dialogue, and from then on the idea stuck. Eventually I decided to pattern each 
Dialogue in one way or another on a different piece by Bach. This was not so 
inappropriate. Old Bach himself used to remind his pupils that the separate parts in their 
compositions should behave like "persons who conversed together as if in a select 
company". I have taken that suggestion perhaps rather more literally than Bach intended 
it; nevertheless I hope the result is faithful to the meaning. I have been particularly 
inspired by aspects of Bach's compositions which have struck me over and over, and 
which are so well described by David and Mendel in The Bach Reader: 
His form in general was based on relations between separate sections. These relations 
ranged from complete identity of passages on the one hand to the 

return of a single principle of elaboration or a mere thematic allusion on the other. The 
resulting patterns were often symmetrical, but by no means 

necessarily so. Sometimes the relations between the various sections make up a maze of 
interwoven threads that only detailed analysis can unravel. Usually, 
however, a few dominant features afford proper orientation at first sight or hearing, and 
while in the course of study one may discover unending sub 

tleties, one is never at a loss to grasp the unity that holds together every single creation by 
Bach.' 

I have sought to weave an Eternal Golden Braid out of these three strands: Godel, 
Escher, Bach. I began, intending to write an essay at the core of which would be Godel's 
Theorem. I imagined it would be a mere pamphlet. But my ideas expanded like a sphere, 
and soon touched Bach and Escher. It took some time for me to think of making this 
connection explicit, instead of just letting it be a private motivating force. But finally 1 
realized that to me, Godel and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different 
directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and 
came up with this book.

Three-Part Invention 



Achilles (a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals) and a Tortoise are 
standing together on a dusty runway in the hot sun. Far down the runway, on a 
tall flagpole, there hangs a large rectangular flag. The flag is sold red, except 
where a thin ring-shaped holes has been cut out of it, through which one can see 
the sky. 

ACHILLES: What is that strange flag down at the other end of the track? It reminds me 

somehow of a print by my favourite artists M.C. Escher. 
TORTOISE: That is Zeno' s flag 

ACHILLES: Could it be that the hole in it resembles the holes in a Mobian strip Escher once 

drew? Something is wrong about the flag, I can tell. 
TORTOISE: The ring which has been cut from it has the shape of the numeral for zero, which 

is Zeno's favourite number. 
ACHILLES: The ring which hasn't been invented yet! It will only be invented by a Hindu 

mathematician some millennia hence. And thus, Mr. T, mt argument proves that such a 

flag is impossible. 

TORTOISE: Your argument is persuasive, Achilles, and I must agree that such a flag is indeed 

impossible. But it is beautiful anyway, is it not? 
ACHILLES: Oh, yes, there is no doubt of its beauty. 

TORTOISE: I wonder if it's beauty is related to it's impossibility. I don't know, I've never had 
the time to analyze Beauty. It's a Capitalized Essence, and I never seem to have time for 
Capitalized Essences. 

ACHILLES: Speaking of Capitalized Essences, Mr. T, have you ever wondered about the 

Purpose of Life? 
TORTOISE: Oh, heavens, no; 

ACHILLES: Haven't you ever wondered why we are here, or who invented us? 

TORTOISE: Oh, that is quite another matter. We are inventions of Zeno (as you will shortly 

see) and the reason we are here is to have a footrace. 
ACHILLES::: A footrace? How outrageous! Me, the fleetest of foot of all mortals, versus you, 

the ploddingest of the plodders! There can be no point to such a race. 
TORTOISE: You might give me a head start. 
ACHILLES: It would have to be a huge one. 
TORTOISE: I don't object. 

ACHILLES: But I will catch you, sooner or later - most likely sooner. 

TORTOISE: Not if things go according to Zeno's paradox, you won't. Zeno is hoping to use 
our footrace to show that motion is impossible, you see. It is only in the mind that motion 
seems possible, according to Zeno. In truth, Motion Is Inherently Impossible. He proves 
it quite elegantly. 



Three-Part Invention 



37 



Figure 10. Mobius strip by M.C.Escher (wood-engraving printed from four blocks, 1961) 



ACHILLES: Oh, yes, it comes back to me now: the famous Zen koan about Zen 

Master Zeno. As you say it is very simple indeed. 
TORTOISE: Zen Koan? Zen Master? What do you mean? 

ACHILLES: It goes like this: Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said, "The 
flag is moving." The other said, "The wind is moving." The sixth patriarch, Zeno, 
happened to be passing by. He told them, "Not the wind, not the flag, mind is 
moving." 

TORTOISE: I am afraid you are a little befuddled, Achilles. Zeno is no Zen master, far 
from it. He is in fact, a Greek philosopher from the town of Elea (which lies halfway 
between points A and B). Centuries hence, he will be celebrated for his paradoxes of 
motion. In one of those paradoxes, this very footrace between you and me will play a 
central role. 

ACHILLES: I'm all confused. I remember vividly how I used to repeat over and over 
the names of the six patriarchs of Zen, and I always said, "The sixth patriarch is Zeno, 
The sixth patriarch is Zeno..." {Suddenly a soft warm breeze picks up.) Oh, look Mr. 
Tortoise - look at the flag waving! How I love to watch the ripples shimmer through 
it's soft fabric. And the ring cut out of it is waving, too! 



Three-Part Invention 



38 



TORTOISE: Don't be silly. The flag is impossible, hence it can't be waving. The wind is 
waving. 

(At this moment, Zeno happens by.) 

Zeno: Hallo! Hulloo! What's up? What's new? 
ACHILLES: The flag is moving. 
TORTOISE: The wind is moving. 

Zeno: O friends, Friends! Cease your argumentation! Arrest your vitriolics! Abandon your 

discord! For I shall resolve the issue for you forthwith. Ho! And on such a fine day. 
ACHILLES: This fellow must be playing the fool. 

TORTOISE: No, wait, Achilles. Let us hear what he has to say. Oh Unknown Sir, do impart to 

us your thoughts on this matter. 
Zeno: Most willingly. Not thw ind, not the flag - neither one is moving, nor is anything moving 

at all. For I have discovered a great Theorem, which states; "Motion Is Inherently 

Impossible." And from this Theorem follows an even greater Theorem - Zeno's 

Theorem: "Motion Unexists." 
ACHILLES: "Zeno's Theorem"? Are you, sir, by any chance, the philosopher Zeno of Elea? 
Zeno: I am indeed, Achilles. 

ACHILLES: (scratching his head in puzzlement). Now how did he know my name? 

Zeno: Could I possibly persuade you two to hear me out as to why this is the case? I've come 
all the way to Elea from point A this afternoon, just trying to find someone who'll pay 
some attention to my closely honed argument. But they're all hurrying hither and thither, 
and they don't have time. You've no idea how disheartening it is to meet with refusal 
after refusal. Oh, I'm sorry to burden you with my troubles, I'd just like to ask you one 
thing: Would the two of you humour a sill old philosopher for a few moments - only a 
few, I promise you - in his eccentric theories. 

ACHILLES: Oh, by all means! Please do illuminate us! I know I speak for both of us, since my 
companion, Mr. Tortoise, was only moments ago speaking of you with great veneration - 
and he mentioned especially your paradoxes. 

Zeno: Thank you. You see, my Master, the fifth patriarch, taught me that reality is one, 
immutable, and unchanging, all plurality, change, and motion are mere illusions of the 
sense. Some have mocked his views; but I will show the absurdity of their mockery. My 
argument is quite simple. I will illustrate it with two characters of my own Invention: 
Achilles )a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals), and a Tortoise. In my tale, 
they are persuaded by a passerby to run a footrace down a runway towards a distant flag 
waving in the breeze. Let us assume that, since the Tortoise is a much slowerrunner, he 
gets a head start of, say, ten rods. Now the race begins. In a few bounds Achilles has 
reached the spot where the Tortoise started. 



Three-Part Invention 



39 



ACHILLES: Hah! 

Zeno: And now the Tortoise is but a single rod ahead of Achilles. Within only a moment, 

Achilles has attained that spot. 
ACHILLES: Ho ho! 

Zeno: Yet, in that short moment, the Tortoise has managed to advance a slight amount. In a 

flash, Achilles covers that distance too. 
ACHILLES : Hee hee hee ! 

Zeno: But in that very short flash, the Tortoise has managed to inch ahead by ever so little, and 
so Achilles is still behind. Now you see that in order for Achilles to catch the Tortoise, 
this game of "try-to-catch-me" will have to be played an INFINITE number of times - 
and therefore Achilles can NEVER catch up with the Tortoise. 

TORTOISE: Heh heh heh heh! 

ACHILLES: Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm...That argument sounds wrong to me. 

And yes, I can't quite make out what's wrong with it 
Zeno: Isn't it a teaser? It's my favourite paradox. 

TORTOISE: Excuse me, Zeno, but I believe your tale illustrates the wrong principle, doe sit 
not? You have just told us what will come to known, centuries hence, as Zeno's "Achilles 
paradox" , which shows (ahem!) that Achilles will never catch the Tortoise; but the proof 
that Motion Is Inherently Impossible (and thence that Motion Unexists) is your 
"dichotomy paradox", isn't that so? 

Zeno: Oh, shame on me. Of course, you're right. That's the new one about how, in going from 
A to B, one has to go halfway first - and of that stretch one also has to go halfway, and so 
on and so forth. But you see, both those paradoxes really have the same flavour. Frankly, 
I've only had one Great Idea - I just exploit it in different ways. 

ACHILLES: I swear, these arguments contain a flaw. I don't quite see where, but they cannot 
be correct. 

Zeno: You doubt the validity of my paradox? Why not just try it out|? You see that red flag 

waving down here, at the far end of the runway? 
ACHILLES: The impossible one, based on an Escher print? 

Zeno: Exactly. What do you say to you and Mr. Tortoise racing for it, allowing Mr. T a fair 

head start of, well, I don't know - 
TORTOISE: How about ten rods? 
Zeno: Very good - ten rods. 
ACHILLES: Any time. 

Zeno: Excellent! How exciting! An empirical test of my rigorously proven Theorem! Mr. 
Tortoise, will you position yourself ten rods upwind? 

( The Tortoise moves ten rods closer to the flag) 

Tortoise and Achlles: Ready! 
Zeno: On your mark! Get set! Go!

Chapter 1 



The MU-puzzle 



Formal Systems 

ONE OF THE most central notions in this book is that of a formal system. The type of 
formal system I use was invented by the American logician Emil Post in the 1920's, and 
is often called a "Post production system". This Chapter introduces you to a formal 
system and moreover, it is my hope that you will want to explore this formal system at 
least a little; so to provoke your curiosity, I have posed a little puzzle. 

"Can you produce MU?" is the puzzle. To begin with, you will be supplied with a 
string (which means a string of letters).* Not to keep you in suspense, that string will be 
MI. Then you will be told some rules, with which you can change one string into another. 
If one of those rules is applicable at some point, and you want to use it, you may, but- 
there is nothing that will dictate which rule you should use, in case there are several 
applicable rules. That is left up to you-and of course, that is where playing the game of 
any formal system can become something of an art. The major point, which almost 
doesn't need stating, is that you must not do anything which is outside the rules. We 
might call this restriction the "Requirement of Formality". In the present Chapter, it 
probably won't need to be stressed at all. Strange though it may sound, though, I predict 
that when you play around with some of the formal systems of Chapters to come, you 
will find yourself violating the Requirement of Formality over and over again, unless you 
have worked with formal systems before. 

The first thing to say about our formal system-the MlU-system-is that it utilizes 
only three letters of the alphabet: M, I, U. That means that the only strings of the MIU- 
system are strings which are composed of those three letters. Below are some strings of 
the MlU-system: 

MU 
UIM 

MUUMUU 

UIIUMIUUIMUIIUMIUUIMUIIU 

* In this book, we shall employ the following conventions when we refer to strings. When the 
string is in the same typeface as the text, then it will be enclosed in single or double quotes. 
Punctuation which belongs to the sentence and not to the string under discussion will go outside 
of the quotes, as logic dictates. For example, the first letter of this sentence is 'F', while the first 
letter of 'this 'sentence'. is 't'. When the string is in Quadrata Roman, however, quotes will 
usually be left off, unless clarity demands them. For example, the first letter of Quadrata is Q. 



The MU-puzzle 



41 



But although all of these are legitimate strings, they are not strings which are "in your 
possession". In fact, the only string in your possession so far is MI. Only by using the 
rules, about to be introduced, can you enlarge your private collection. Here is the first 
rule: 

RULE I: If you possess a string whose last letter is I, you can add on a U at the end. 

By the way, if up to this point you had not guessed it, a fact about the meaning of "string" 
is that the letters are in a fixed order. For example, MI and IM are two different strings. 
A string of symbols is not just a "bag" of symbols, in which the order doesn't make any 
difference. 

Here is the second rule: 

RULE II: Suppose you have Mx. Then you may add Mxx to your collection. 

What I mean by this is shown below, in a few examples. 

From MIU, you may get MIUIU. 
From MUM, you may get MUMUM. 
From MU, you may get MUU. 

So the letter V in the rule simply stands for any string; but once you have decided which 
string it stands for, you have to stick with your choice (until you use the rule again, at 
which point you may make a new choice). Notice the third example above. It shows how, 
once you possess MU, you can add another string to your collection; but you have to get 
MU first! I want to add one last comment about the letter V: it is not part of the formal 
system in the same way as the three letters 'M', 'I', and 'U' are. It is useful for us, 
though, to have some way to talk in general about strings of the system, symbolically-and 
that is the function of the V: to stand for an arbitrary string. If you ever add a string 
containing an Y to your "collection", you have done something wrong, because strings of 
the MlU-system never contain "x" "s"! 
Here is the third rule: 

RULE III: If III occurs in one of the strings in your collection, you may make a new 
string with U in place of III. 

Examples: 

From UMIIIMU, you could make UMUMU. 
From MII11, you could make MIU (also MUI). 
From IIMII, you can't get anywhere using this rule. 

(The three I's have to be consecutive.) 
From Mill, make MU. 

Don't, under any circumstances, think you can run this rule backwards, as in the 
following example: 



The MU-puzzle 



42 



From MU, make Mill 



<- This is wrong. 



Rules are one-way. 

Here is the final rule. 

RULE IV: If UU occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it. 

From UUU, get U. 

From MUUUIII, get MUIII. 

There you have it. Now you may begin trying to make MU. Don't worry you don't get it. 
Just try it out a bit-the main thing is for you to get the flavor of this MU-puzzle. Have 
fun. 

Theorems, Axioms, Rules 

The answer to the MU-puzzle appears later in the book. For now, what important is not 
finding the answer, but looking for it. You probably hay made some attempts to produce 
MU. In so doing, you have built up your own private collection of strings. Such strings, 
producible by the rules, are called theorems. The term "theorem" has, of course, a 
common usage mathematics which is quite different from this one. It means some 
statement in ordinary language which has been proven to be true by a rigorous argument, 
such as Zeno's Theorem about the "unexistence" of motion, c Euclid's Theorem about the 
infinitude of primes. But in formal system theorems need not be thought of as statements- 
they are merely strings c symbols. And instead of being proven, theorems are merely 
produced, as if F machine, according to certain typographical rules. To emphasize this 
important distinction in meanings for the word "theorem", I will adopt the following 
convention in this book: when "theorem" is capitalized, its meaning will be the everyday 
one-a Theorem is a statement in ordinary language which somebody once proved to be 
true by some sort of logic argument. When uncapitalized, "theorem" will have its 
technical meaning a string producible in some formal system. In these terms, the MU- 
puzzle asks whether MU is a theorem of the MlU-system. 

I gave you a theorem for free at the beginning, namely MI. Such "free" theorem is called 
an axiom-thc technical meaning again being qui different from the usual meaning. A 
formal system may have zero, or several, or even infinitely many axioms. Examples of all 
these types v appear in the book. 

Every formal system has symbol-shunting rules, such as the four rules of the MIU- 
system. These rules are called either rules of production or rules of inference. I will use 
both terms. 

The last term which I wish to introduce at this point is derivation. Shown below is a 
derivation of the theorem MUIIU: 

(1) MI axiom 

(2) Mil from (1) by rule II 



The MU-puzzle 



43 



(3) Mill 

(4) MIIIIU 

(5) MUIU 



from (2) by rule II 
from (3) by rule I 
from (4) by rule III 
from (5) by rule II 
from (6) by rule IV 



(6) MUIUUIU 

(7) MUIIU 



A derivation of a theorem is an explicit, line-by-line demonstration of how to produce 
that theorem according to the rules of the formal system. The concept of derivation is 
modeled on that of proof, but a derivation is an austere cousin of a proof. It would sound 
strange to say that you had proven MUIIU, but it does not sound so strange to say you 
have derived MUIIU. 



Most people go about the MU-puzzle by deriving a number of theorems, quite at random, 
just to see what kind of thing turns up. Pretty soon, they begin to notice some properties 
of the theorems they have made; that is where human intelligence enters the picture. For 
instance, it was probably not obvious to you that all theorems would begin with M, until 
you had tried a few. Then, the pattern emerged, and not only could you see the pattern, 
but you could understand it by looking at the rules, which have the property that they 
make each new theorem inherit its first letter from an earlier theorem; ultimately, then, all 
theorems' first letters can be traced back to the first letter of the sole axiom Ml-and that is 
a proof that theorems of the MlU-system must all begin with M. 

There is something very significant about what has happened here. It shows one 
difference between people and machines. It would certainly be possible-in fact it would 
be very easy-to program a computer to generate theorem after theorem of the MIU- 
system; and we could include in the program a command to stop only upon generating U. 
You now know that a computer so programmed would never stop. And this does not 
amaze you. But what if you asked a friend to try to generate U? It would not surprise you 
if he came back after a while, complaining that he can't get rid of the initial M, and 
therefore it is a wild goose chase. Even if a person is not very bright, he still cannot help 
making some observations about what he is doing, and these observations give him good 
insight into the task- insight which the computer program, as we have described it, lacks. 

Now let me be very explicit about what I meant by saying this shows a difference 
between people and machines. I meant that it is possible to program a machine to do a 
routine task in such a way that the machine will never notice even the most obvious facts 
about what it is doing; but it is inherent in human consciousness to notice some facts 
about the things one is doing. But you knew this all along. If you punch "1" into an 
adding machine, and then add 1 to it, and then add 1 again, and again, and again, and 
continue doing so for hours and hours, the machine will never learn to anticipate you, and 
do it itself, although any person would pick up the 



The MU-puzzle 44 



Inside and Outside the System 



pick up the idea, no matter how much or how well it is driven, that it i supposed to avoid 
other cars and obstacles on the road; and it will never learn even the most frequently 
traveled routes of its owner. 

The difference, then, is that it is possible for a machine to act unobservant; it is 
impossible for a human to act unobservant. Notice I am not saying that all machines are 
necessarily incapable of making sophisticated observations; just that some machines are. 
Nor am I saying that all people are always making sophisticated observations; people, in 
fact, are often very unobservant. But machines can be made to be totally unobservant; 
any people cannot. And in fact, most machines made so far are pretty close ti being 
totally unobservant. Probably for this reason, the property of being; unobservant seems to 
be the characteristic feature of machines, to most people. For example, if somebody says 
that some task is "mechanical", i does not mean that people are incapable of doing the 
task; it implies though, that only a machine could do it over and over without eve 
complaining, or feeling bored. 

Jumping out of the System 

It is an inherent property of intelligence that it can jump out of the tas which it is 
performing, and survey what it has done; it is always looking for and often finding, 
patterns. Now I said that an intelligence can jump out o its task, but that does not mean 
that it always will. However, a little prompting will often suffice. For example, a human 
being who is reading a boo may grow sleepy. Instead of continuing to read until the book 
is finished he is just as likely to put the book aside and turn off the light. He ha stepped 
"out of the system" and yet it seems the most natural thing in the world to us. Or, suppose 
person A is watching television when person B comes in the room, and shows evident 
displeasure with the situation Person A may think he understands the problem, and try to 
remedy it b exiting the present system (that television program), and flipping the channel 
knob, looking for a better show. Person B may have a more radio concept of what it is to 
"exit the system" -namely to turn the television oft Of course, there are cases where only a 
rare individual will have the vision to perceive a system which governs many peoples 
lives, a system which ha never before even been recognized as a system; then such people 
often devote their lives to convincing other people that the system really is there and that 
it ought to be exited from! 

How well have computers been taught to jump out of the system? I w cite one 
example which surprised some observers. In a computer chess: tournament not long ago 
in Canada, one program-the weakest of all the competing ones-had the unusual feature of 
quitting long before the game was over. It was not a very good chess player, but it at least 
had the redeeming quality of being able to spot a hopeless position, and to resign then 
and there, instead of waiting for the other program to go through the 



The MU-puzzle 



45 



boring ritual of checkmating. Although it lost every game it played, it did it in style. A lot 
of local chess experts were impressed. Thus, if you define "the system" as "making 
moves in a chess game", it is clear that this program had a sophisticated, preprogrammed 
ability to exit from the system. On the other hand, if you think of "the system" as being 
"whatever the computer had been programmed to do", then there is no doubt that the 
computer had no ability whatsoever to exit from that system. 

It is very important when studying formal systems to distinguish working within 
the system from making statements or observations about the system. I assume that you 
began the MU-puzzle, as do most people, by working within the system; and that you 
then gradually started getting anxious, and this anxiety finally built up to the point where 
without any need for further consideration, you exited from the system, trying to take 
stock of what you had produced, and wondering why it was that you had not succeeded in 
producing MU. Perhaps you found a reason why you could not produce MU; that is 
thinking about the system. Perhaps you produced MIU somewhere along the way; that is 
working within the system. Now I do not want to make it sound as if the two modes are 
entirely incompatible; I am sure that every human being is capable to some extent of 
working inside a system and simultaneously thinking about what he is doing. Actually, in 
human affairs, it is often next to impossible to break things neatly up into "inside the 
system" and "outside the system"; life is composed of so many interlocking and 
interwoven and often inconsistent "systems" that it may seem simplistic to think of things 
in those terms. But it is often important to formulate simple ideas very clearly so that one 
can use them as models in thinking about more complex ideas. And that is why I am 
showing you formal systems; and it is about time we went back to discussing the MIU- 
system. 



M-Mode, I-Mode, U-Mode 

The MU-puzzle was stated in such a way that it encouraged some amount of exploration 
within the MlU-system-deriving theorems. But it was also stated in a way so as not to 
imply that staying inside the system would necessarily yield fruit. Therefore it 
encouraged some oscillation between the two modes of work. One way to separate these 
two modes would be to have two sheets of paper; on one sheet, you work "in your 
capacity as a machine", thus filling it with nothing but M's, I's, and U's; on the second 
sheet, you work "in your capacity as a thinking being", and are allowed to do whatever 
your intelligence suggests-which might involve using English, sketching ideas, working 
backwards, using shorthand (such as the letter V), compressing several steps into one, 
modifying the rules of the system to see what that gives, or whatever else you might 
dream up. One thing you might do is notice that the numbers 3 and 2 play an important 
role, since I's are gotten rid of in three's, and U's in two's-and doubling of length (except 
for the M) is allowed by rule II. So the second sheet might 



The MU-puzzle 



46 



also have some figuring on it. We will occasionally refer back to these two modes of 
dealing with a formal system, and we will call them the Mechanic mode (M-mode) and 
the Intelligent mode (I-mode). To round out our mode with one for each letter of the 
MlU-system, I will also mention a fin mode-the Un-mode (U-mode), which is the Zen 
way of approaching thing. More about this in a few Chapters. 

Decision Procedures 

An observation about this puzzle is that it involves rules of two opposite tendencies-the 
lengthening rules and the shortening rules. Two rules (I and II) allow you to increase the 
size of strings (but only in very rigid, pr scribed ways, of course); and two others allow 
you to shrink strings somewhat (again in very rigid ways). There seems to be an endless 
variety to the order in which these different types of rules might be applied, and this gives 
hope that one way or another, MU could be produced. It might involve lengthening the 
string to some gigantic size, and then extracting piece after piece until only two symbols 
are left; or, worse yet, it might involve successive stages of lengthening and then 
shortening and then lengthening and then shortening, and so on. But there is no guarantee 
it. As a matter of fact, we already observed that U cannot be produced at all and it will 
make no difference if you lengthen and shorten till kingdom come. 

Still, the case of U and the case of MU seem quite different. It is by very 
superficial feature of U that we recognize the impossibility of producing it: it doesn't 
begin with an M (whereas all theorems must). It is very convenient to have such a simple 
way to detect nontheorems. However who says that that test will detect all nontheorems? 
There may be lots strings which begin with M but are not producible. Maybe MU is one 
of them. That would mean that the "first-letter test" is of limited usefulness able only to 
detect a portion of the nontheorems, but missing others. B there remains the possibility of 
some more elaborate test which discriminates perfectly between those strings which can 
be produced by the rules and those which cannot. Here we have to face the question, 
"What do mean by a test?" It may not be obvious why that question makes sense, of 
important, in this context. But I will give an example of a "test" which somehow seems to 
violate the spirit of the word. 

Imagine a genie who has all the time in the world, and who enjoys using it to 
produce theorems of the MlU-system, in a rather methodical way. Here, for instance, is a 
possible way the genie might go about it 

Step 1: Apply every applicable rule to the axiom MI. This yields two new theorems 
MIU, Mil. 

Step 2: Apply every applicable rule to the theorems produced in step 1. This yields 
three new theorems: MIIU, MIUIU, MIIII. 



The MU-puzzle 



47 



Step 3: Apply every applicable rule to the theorems produced in step 2. This yields 
five new theorems: MIIIIU, MIIUIIU, MIUIUIUIU, MIIIIIIII, MUI. 



This method produces every single theorem sooner or later, because the rules are applied 
in every conceivable order. (See Fig. 11.) All of the lengthening-shortening alternations 
which we mentioned above eventually get carried out. However, it is not clear how long 
to wait for a given string

to appear on this list, since theorems are listed according to the shortness of their 
derivations. This is not a very useful order, if you are interested in a specific string (such 
as MU), and you don't even know if it has any derivation, much less how long that 
derivation might be. 

Now we state the proposed "theoremhood-test": 

Wait until the string in question is produced; when that happens, you know it 
is a theorem-and if it never happens, you know that it is not a theorem. 

This seems ridiculous, because it presupposes that we don't mind waiting around literally 
an infinite length of time for our answer. This gets to the crux of the matter of what 
should count as a "test". Of prime importance is a guarantee that we will get our answer 
in a finite length of time. If there is a test for theoremhood, a test which does always 
terminate in a finite 



The MU-puzzle 



48 



amount of time, then that test is called a decision procedure for the given formal system. 

When you have a decision procedure, then you have a very concrete 
characterization of the nature of all theorems in the system. Offhand, it might seem that 
the rules and axioms of the formal system provide no less complete a characterization of 
the theorems of the system than a decision procedure would. The tricky word here is 
"characterization". Certainly the rules of inference and the axioms of the MlU-system do 
characterize, implicitly, those strings that are theorems. Even more implicitly, they 
characterize those strings that are not theorems. But implicit characterization is not 
enough, for many purposes. If someone claims to have a characterization of all theorems, 
but it takes him infinitely long to deduce that some particular string is not a theorem, you 
would probably tend to say that there is something lacking in that characterization-it is 
not quite concrete enough. And that is why discovering that a decision procedure exists is 
a very important step. What the discovery means, in effect, is that you can perform a test 
for theoremhood of a string, and that, even if the test is complicated, it is guaranteed to 
terminate. In principle, the test is just as easy, just as mechanical, just as finite, just as full 
of certitude, as checking whether the first letter of the string is M. A decision procedure 
is a "litmus test" for theoremhood! 

Incidentally, one requirement on formal systems is that the set of axioms must be 
characterized by a decision procedure -there must be a litmus test for axiomhood. This 
ensures that there is no problem in getting off the ground at the beginning, at least. That 
is the difference between the set of axioms and the set of theorems: the former always has 
a decision procedure, but the latter may not. 

I am sure you will agree that when you looked at the MlU-system for the first 
time, you had to face this problem exactly. The lone axiom was known, the rules of 
inference were simple, so the theorems had been implicitly characterized-and yet it was 
still quite unclear what the consequences of that characterization were. In particular, it 
was still totally unclear whether MU is, or is not, a theorem.

or, 

What the Tortoise Said to Achilles 

by Lewis Carroll' 

Achilles had overtaken the Tortoise, and had seated himself comfortably on its back. 

"So you've got to the end of our race-course?" said the Tortoise. "Even though it 
DOES consist of an infinite series of distances? I thought some wiseacre or other had 
proved that the thing couldn't be done?" 

"It CAN be done," said Achilles. "It HAS been done! Solvitur ambulando. You see the 
distances were constantly DIMINISHING; and so-" 

"But if they had been constantly INCREASING?" the Tortoise interrupted. "How 
then?" 

"Then I shouldn't be here," Achilles modestly replied; "and You would have got 
several times round the world, by this time!" 

"You flatter me-FLATTEN, I mean," said the Tortoise; "for you ARE a heavy weight, 
and NO mistake! Well now, would you like to hear of a race-course, that most people 
fancy they can get to the end of in two or three steps, while it REALLY consists of an 
infinite number of distances, each one longer than the previous one?" 

"Very much indeed!" said the Grecian warrior, as he drew from his helmet (few 
Grecian warriors possessed POCKETS in those days) an enormous note-book and pencil. 
"Proceed! And speak SLOWLY, please! SHORTHAND isn't invented yet!" 

"That beautiful First Proposition by Euclid!" the Tortoise murmured dreamily. "You 
admire Euclid?" 

"Passionately! So far, at least, as one CAN admire a treatise that won't be published 
for some centuries to come!" 

"Well, now, let's take a little bit of the argument in that First Proposition just TWO 
steps, and the conclusion drawn from them. Kindly enter them in your note -book. And in 
order to refer to them conveniently, let's call them A, B, and Z: 

(A) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other. 

(B) The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same. 
(Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other. 

Readers of Euclid will grant, I suppose, that Z follows logically from A and B, so that 
any one who accepts A and B as true, MUST accept Z as true?" 

"Undoubtedly! The youngest child in a High School-as soon as High 



Two-Part Invention 



51 



Schools are invented, which will not be till some two thousand years later-will grant 
THAT." 

"And if some reader had NOT yet accepted A and B as true, he might still accept the 
SEQUENCE as a VALID one, I suppose?" 

"No doubt such a reader might exist. He might say, T accept as true the Hypothetical 
Proposition that, IF A and B be true, Z must be true; but I DON'T accept A and B as true.' 
Such a reader would do wisely in abandoning Euclid, and taking to football." 

"And might there not ALSO be some reader who would say T accept A and B as true, 
but I DON'T accept the Hypothetical'?" 

"Certainly there might. HE, also, had better take to football." 

"And NEITHER of these readers," the Tortoise continued, "is AS YET under any 
logical necessity to accept Z as true?" 
"Quite so," Achilles assented. 

"Well, now, I want you to consider ME as a reader of the SECOND kind, and to force 
me, logically, to accept Z as true." 

"A tortoise playing football would be-" Achilles was beginning. 

x -an anomaly, of course," the Tortoise hastily interrupted. "Don't wander from the 
point. Let's have Z first, and football afterwards!" 

"I'm to force you to accept Z, am I?" Achilles said musingly. "And your present 
position is that you accept A and B, but you DON'T accept the Hypothetical-" 

"Let's call it C," said the Tortoise. 

"-but you DON'T accept 

(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true." 

"That is my present position," said the Tortoise. 
"Then I must ask you to accept C." 

"I'll do so," said the Tortoise, "as soon as you've entered it in that notebook of yours. 
What else have you got in it?" 

"Only a few memoranda," said Achilles, nervously fluttering the leaves: "a few 
memoranda of-of the battles in which I have distinguished myself! " 

"Plenty of blank leaves, I see!" the Tortoise cheerily remarked. "We shall need them 
ALL!" (Achilles shuddered.) "Now write as I dictate: 

(A) Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other. 

(B) The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same. 

(C) If A and B are true, Z must be true. 

(Z) The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other." 

"You should call it D, not Z," said Achilles. "It comes NEXT to the other three. If you 
accept A and B and C, you MUST accept Z. 



Two-Part Invention 



52 



"And why must I?" 

"Because it follows LOGICALLY from them. If A and B and C are true, Z MUST be 
true. You can't dispute THAT, I imagine?" 

"If A and B and C are true, Z MUST be true," the Tortoise thoughtfully repeated. 
"That's ANOTHER Hypothetical, isn't it? And, if I failed to see its truth, I might accept A 
and B and C, and STILL not accept Z, mightn't I?" 

"You might," the candid hero admitted; "though such obtuseness would certainly be 
phenomenal. Still, the event is POSSIBLE. So I must ask you to grant ONE more 
Hypothetical." 

"Very good, I'm quite willing to grant it, as soon as you've written it down. We will 
call it 

(D) If A and B and C are true, Z must be true. 

Have you entered that in your note -book?" 

"I HAVE!" Achilles joyfully exclaimed, as he ran the pencil into its sheath. "And at 
last we've got to the end of this ideal race-course! Now that you accept A and B and C 
and D, OF COURSE you accept Z." 

"Do I?" said the Tortoise innocently. "Let's make that quite clear. I accept A and B and 
C and D. Suppose I STILL refused to accept Z?" 

"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and FORCE you to do it!" Achilles 
triumphantly replied. "Logic would tell you, "You can't help yourself. Now that you've 
accepted A and B and C and D, you MUST accept Z!' So you've no choice, you see.", 

"Whatever LOGIC is good enough to tell me is worth WRITING DOWN," said the 
Tortoise. "So enter it in your book, please. We will call it 

(E) If A and B and C and D are true, Z must be true. 

Until I've granted THAT, of course I needn't grant Z. So it's quite a NECESSARY 
step, you see?" 

"I see," said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone. 

Here the narrator, having pressing business at the Bank, was obliged to leave the 
happy pair, and did not again pass the spot until some months afterwards. When he did 
so, Achilles was still seated on the back of the much-enduring Tortoise, and was writing 
in his notebook, which appeared to be nearly full. The Tortoise was saying, "Have you 
got that last step written down? Unless I've lost count, that makes a thousand and one. 
There are several millions more to come. And WOULD you mind, as a personal favour, 
considering what a lot of instruction this colloquy of ours will provide for the Logicians 
of the Nineteenth Century- WOULD you mind adopting a pun that my cousin the Mock- 
Turtle will then make, and allowing yourself to be renamed TAUGHT-US?" 

"As you please," replied the weary warrior, in the hollow tones of despair, as he buried 
his face in his hands. "Provided that YOU, for YOUR part, will adopt a pun the Mock- 
Turtle never made, and allow yourself to be re-named A KILL-EASE!"

CHAPTER 11 



Meaning and Form 
in Mathematics. 

THIS Two-Part Invention was the inspiration for my two characters. Just as Lewis 
Carroll took liberties with Zeno's Tortoise and Achilles, so have I taken liberties with 
Lewis Carroll's Tortoise and Achilles. In Carroll's dialogue, the same events take place 
over and over again, only each time on a higher and higher level; it is a wonderful 
analogue to Bach's Ever-Rising Canon. The Carrollian Dialogue, with its wit subtracted 
out, still leaves a deep philosophical problem: Do words and thoughts follow formal 
rules, or do they noft That problem is the problem of this book. 

In this Chapter and the next, we will look at several new formal systems. This will give 
us a much wider perspective on the concept of formal system. By the end of these two 
Chapters, you should have quite a good idea of the power of formal systems, and why 
they are of interest to mathematicians and logicians. 

The pq-System 

The formal system of this Chapter is called the pq-system. It is not important to 
mathematicians or logicians-in fact, it is just a simple invention of mine. Its importance 
lies only in the fact that it provides an excellent example of many ideas that play a large 
role in this book. There are three distinct symbols of the pq-system: 

p q - 

-the letters p, q, and the hyphen. 

The pq-system has an infinite number of axioms. Since we can't write them all down, we 
have to have some other way of describing what they are. Actually, we want more than 
just a description of the axioms; we want a way to tell whether some given string is an 
axiom or not. A mere description of axioms might characterize them fully and yet 
weakly-which was the problem with the way theorems in the MlU-system were 
characterized. We don't want to have to struggle for an indeterminate-possibly infinite 
length of time, just to find out if some string is an axiom or not. Therefore, we will define 
axioms in such a way that there is an obvious decision procedure for axiomhood of a 
string composed of p's, q's, and hyphens. 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



54 



DEFINITION: xp-qx is an axiom, whenever x is composed of hyphens only. 

Note that 'x' must stand for the same string of hyphens in both occurrences For example, - 
-p-q — is an axiom. The literal expression 'xp-qx-' i„ not an axiom, of course (because V 
does not belong to the pq-system); it is more like a mold in which all axioms are cast-and 
it is called an axiom schema. 

The pq-system has only one rule of production: 

RULE: Suppose x, y, and z all stand for particular strings containing only hyphens. And 
suppose that x py qz is known to be a theorem. The' xpy-qz- is a theorem. 

For example, take x to be'--', y to be' — ', and z to be'-'. The rule tells us: 

If ~p — q- turns out to be a theorem, then so will ~p — q~. 

As is typical of rules of production, the statement establishes a causal connection between 
the theoremhood of two strings, but without asserting theoremhood for either one on its 
own. 

A most useful exercise for you is to find a decision procedure for the theorems of 
the pq-system. It is not hard; if you play around for a while you will probably pick it up. 
Try it. 

The Decision Procedure 

I presume you have tried it. First of all, though it may seem too obvious to mention, I 
would like to point out that every theorem of the pq-system has three separate groups of 
hyphens, and the separating elements are one p, and one q, in that order. (This can be 
shown by an argument based on "heredity", just the way one could show that all MIU- 
system theorems had to begin with M.) This means that we can rule out, from its form 
alone, o string such as ~p~p~p— q . 

Now, stressing the phrase "from its form alone" may seem silly; what else is there to a 
string except its form? What else could possibly play a roll in determining its properties? 
Clearly nothing could. But bear this in mint as the discussion of formal systems goes on; 
the notion of "form" will star to get rather more complicated and abstract, and we will 
have to think more about the meaning of the word "form". In any case, let us give the 
name well formed string to any string which begins with a hyphen-group, then ha one p, 
then has a second hyphen-group, then a q, and then a final hyphen-group. 
Back to the decision procedure ... The criterion for theoremhood is that the first two 
hyphen-groups should add up, in length, to the third 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



55 



hyphen-group, for instance, ~p~q - is a theorem, since 2 plus 2 equals 4, whereas — p— q- 
is not, since 2 plus 2 is not 1. To see why this is the proper criterion, look first at the 
axiom schema. Obviously, it only manufactures axioms which satisfy the addition 
criterion. Second, look at the rule of production. If the first string satisfies the addition 
criterion, so must the second one-and conversely, if the first string does not satisfy the 
addition criterion, then neither does the second string. The rule makes the addition 
criterion into a hereditary property of theorems: any theorem passes the property on to its 
offspring. This shows why the addition criterion is correct. 

There is, incidentally, a fact about the pq-system which would enable us to say 
with confidence that it has a decision procedure, even before finding the addition 
criterion. That fact is that the pq-system is not complicated by the opposing currents of 
lengthening and shortening rules; it has only lengthening rules. Any formal system which 
tells you how to make longer theorems from shorter ones, but never the reverse, has got 
to have a decision procedure for its theorems. For suppose you are given a string. First 
check whether it's an axiom or not (I am assuming that there is a decision procedure for 
axiomhood-otherwise, things are hopeless). If it is an axiom, then it is by definition a 
theorem, and the test is over. So suppose instead that it's not an axiom. Then, to be a 
theorem, it must have come from a shorter string, via one of the rules. By going over the 
various rules one by one, you can pinpoint not only the rules that could conceivably 
produce that string, but also exactly which shorter strings could be its forebears on the 
"family tree". In this way, you "reduce" the problem to determining whether any of 
several new but shorter strings is a theorem. Each of them can in turn be subjected to the 
same test. The worst that can happen is a proliferation of more and more, but shorter and 
shorter, strings to test. As you continue inching your way backwards in this fashion, you 
must be getting closer to the source of all theorems-the axiom schemata. You just can't 
get shorter and shorter indefinitely; therefore, eventually either you will find that one of 
your short strings is an axiom, or you'll come to a point where you're stuck, in that none 
of your short strings is an axiom, and none of them can be further shortened by running 
some rule or other backwards. This points out that there really is not much deep interest 
in formal systems with lengthening rules only; it is the interplay of lengthening and 
shortening rules that gives formal systems a certain fascination.. 

Bottom-up vs. Top-down 

The method above might be called a top-down decision procedure, to be contrasted with a 
bottom-up decision procedure, which I give now. It is very reminiscent of the genie's 
systematic theorem-generating method for the MlU-system, but is complicated by the 
presence of an axiom schema. We are going to form a "bucket" into which we throw 
theorems as they are generated. Here is how it is done: 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



56 



(la) Throw the simplest possible axiom (-p-q~) into the bucket. 

(I b) Apply the rule of inference to the item in the bucket, and put the result into the 
bucket. 

(2a) Throw the second-simplest axiom into the bucket. 

(2b) Apply the rule to each item in the bucket, and throw all results into the bucket. 
(3 a) Throw the third-simplest axiom into the bucket. 

(3b) Apply the rule to each item in the bucket, and throw all results into the bucket, 
etc., etc. 

A moment's reflection will show that you can't fail to produce every theorem of the pq- 
system this way. Moreover, the bucket is getting filled with longer and longer theorems, 
as time goes on. It is again a consequence of that lack of shortening rules. So if you have 
a particular string, such as — p — q — , which you want to test for theoremhood, just 
follow the numbered steps, checking all the while for the string in question. If it turns up- 
theorem! If at some point everything that goes into the bucket is longer than the string in 
question, forget it-it is not a theorem. This decision procedure is bottom=up because it is 
working its way up from the basics, which is to say the axioms. The previous decision 
procedure is top-down because it does precisely the reverse: it works its way back down 
towards the basics. 

Isomorphisms Induce Meaning 

Now we come to a central issue of this Chapter-indeed of the book. Perhaps you have 
already thought to yourself that the pq-theorems are like additions. The string ~p — q — is 
a theorem because 2 plus 3 equals 5. It could even occur to you that the theorem — p — q~ 
is a statement, written in an odd notation, whose meaning is that 2 plus 3 is 5. Is this a 
reasonable way to look at things? Well, I deliberately chose 'p' to remind you of 'plus', 
and 'q' to remind you of 'equals' ... So, does the string — p — q — actually mean "2 plus 
3 equals 5"? 

What would make us feel that way? My answer would be that we have perceived 
an isomorphism between pq-theorems and additions. In the Introduction, the word 
"isomorphism" was defined as an information preserving transformation. We can now go 
into that notion a little more deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word 
"isomorphism' applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in 
such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other 
structure, where "corresponding" means that the two part play similar roles in their 
respective structures. This usage of the word "isomorphism" is derived from a more 
precise notion in mathematics. 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



57 



It is cause for joy when a mathematician discovers an isomorphism between two 
structures which he knows. It is often a "bolt from the blue", and a source of 
wonderment. The perception of an isomorphism between two known structures is a 
significant advance in knowledge-and I claim that it is such perceptions of isomorphism 
which create meanings in the minds of people. A final word on the perception of 
isomorphisms: since they come in many shapes and sizes, figuratively speaking, it is not 
always totally clear when you really have found an isomorphism. Thus, "isomorphism" is 
a word with all the usual vagueness of words- which is a defect but an advantage as well. 

In this case, we have an excellent prototype for the concept of isomorphism. 
There is a "lower level" of our isomorphism-that is, a mapping between the parts of the 
two structures: 

p <= => plus 
q <= => equals 

- <= => one 

— <= => two 
— - <= => three 

etc. 

This symbol-word correspondence has a name: interpretation. 

Secondly, on a higher level, there is the correspondence between true statements 
and theorems. But-note carefully-this higher-level correspondence could not be perceived 
without the prior choice of an interpretation for the symbols. Thus it would be more 
accurate to describe it as a correspondence between true statements and interpreted 
theorems. In any case we have displayed a two-tiered correspondence, which is typical of 
all isomorphisms. 

When you confront a formal system you know nothing of, and if you hope to 
discover some hidden meaning in it, your problem is how to assign interpretations to its 
symbols in a meaningful way-that is, in such a way that a higher-level correspondence 
emerges between true statements and theorems. You may make several tentative stabs in 
the dark before finding a good set of words to associate with the symbols. It is very 
similar to attempts to crack a code, or to decipher inscriptions in an unknown language 
like Linear B of Crete: the only way to proceed is by trial and error, based on educated 
guesses. When you hit a good choice, a "meaningful" choice, all of a sudden things just 
feel right, and work speeds up enormously. Pretty soon everything falls into place. The 
excitement of such an experience is captured in The Decipherment of Linear B by John 
Chadwick. 

But it is uncommon, to say the least, for someone to be in the position of 
"decoding" a formal system turned up in the excavations of a ruined civilization! 
Mathematicians (and more recently, linguists, philosophers, and some others) are the only 
users of formal systems, and they invariably have an interpretation in mind for the formal 
systems which they use and publish. The idea of these people is to set up a formal system 
whose 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



58 



Theorems reflect some portion of reality isomorphically. In such a case, the choice of 
symbols is a highly motivated one, as is the choice of typographical rules of production. 
When I devised the pq-system, I was in position. You see why I chose the symbols I 
chose. It is no accident theorems are isomorphic to additions; it happened because I 
deliberately sought out a way to reflect additions typographically. 

Meaningless and Meaningful Interpretations 

You can choose interpretations other than the one I chose. You need make every 
theorem come out true. But there would be very little reason make an interpretation in 
which, say, all theorems came out false, certainly even less reason to make an 
interpretation under which there is no correlation at all, positive or negative, between 
theoremhood and tri Let us therefore make a distinction between two types of 
interpretations a formal system. First, we can have a meaningless interpretation, one un 
which we fail to see any isomorphic connection between theorems of system, and reality. 
Such interpretations abound-any random choice a will do. For instance, take this one: 

p <= => horse 
q <= => happy 
- <= => apple 

Now -p-q~ acquires a new interpretation: "apple horse apple hat apple apple" -a 
poetic sentiment, which might appeal to horses, and mi! even lead them to favor this 
mode of interpreting pq-strings! However, t interpretation has very little 
"meaningfulness"; under interpretative, theorems don't sound any truer, or any better, 
than nontheorems. A ho might enjoy "happy happy happy apple horse" (mapped onto q q 
q) just as much as any interpreted theorem. 

The other kind of interpretation will be called meaningful. Under si an 
interpretation, theorems and truths correspond-that is, an isomorphism exists between 
theorems and some portion of reality. That is why it is good to distinguish between 
interpretations and meanings. Any old word can be used as an interpretation for p', but 
'plus' is the only meaningful choice we've come up with. In summary, the meaning of "p' 
seems to be 'plus' though it can have a million different interpretations. 

Active vs. Passive Meanings 

Probably the most significant fact of this Chapter, if understood deeply this: the pq- 
system seems to force us into recognizing that symbols of a formal system, though 
initially without meaning, cannot avoid taking on "meaning" of sorts at least if an 
isomorphism is found. The difference between meaning it formal system and in a 
language is a very important one, however. It is this: 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



59 



in a language, when we have learned a meaning for a word, we then mar-c new 
statements based on the meaning of the word. In a sense the meaning becomes active, 
since it brings into being a new rule for creating sentences. This means that our command 
of language is not like a finished product: the rules for making sentences increase when 
we learn new meanings. On the other hand, in a formal system, the theorems are 
predefined, by the rules of production. We can choose "meanings" based on an 
isomorphism (if we can find one) between theorems and true statements. But this does 
not give us the license to go out and add new theorems to the established theorems. That 
is what the Requirement of Formality in Chapter I was warning you of. 

In the MlU-system, of course, there was no temptation to go beyond the four 
rules, because no interpretation was sought or found. But here, in our new system, one 
might be seduced by the newly found "meaning" of each symbol into thinking that the 
string 

-p-p-p-q 

is a theorem. At least, one might wish that this string were a theorem. But wishing doesn't 
change the fact that it isn't. And it would be a serious mistake to think that it "must" be a 
theorem, just because 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 8. It would even be misleading to 
attribute it any meaning at all, since it is not well-formed, and our meaningful 
interpretation is entirely derived from looking at well-formed strings. 

In a formal system, the meaning must remain passive; we can read each string 
according to the meanings of its constituent symbols, but we do not have the right to 
create new theorems purely on the basis of the meanings we've assigned the symbols. 
Interpreted formal systems straddle the line between systems without meaning, and 
systems with meaning. Their strings can be thought of as "expressing" things, but this 
must come only as a consequence of the formal properties of the system. 

Double-Entendre ! 

And now, I want to destroy any illusion about having found the meanings for the symbols 
of the pq-system. Consider the following association: 

p <= => equals 

q <= => taken from 

- <= => one 

— <= => two 

etc. 

Now, ~p — q — has a new interpretation: "2 equals 3 taken from 5". Of course it is a true 
statement. All theorems will come out true under this new interpretation. It is just as 
meaningful as the old one. Obviously, it is silly to ask, "But which one is the meaning of 
the string?" An interpreta

tion will me meaningful to the extent that it accurately reflects some isomorphism to the 
real world. When different aspects of the real world a isomorphic to each other (in this 
case, additions and subtractions), or single formal system can be isomorphic to both, and 
therefore can take ( two passive meanings. This kind of double-valuedness of symbols at 
strings is an extremely important phenomenon. Here it seems trivial curious, annoying. 
But it will come back in deeper contexts and bring with it a great richness of ideas. 

Here is a summary of our observations about the pq-system. Und either of the two 
meaningful interpretations given, every well-form( string has a grammatical assertion for 
its counterpart-some are true, son false. The idea of well formed strings in any formal 
system is that they a those strings which, when interpreted symbol for symbol, yield 
grammatical sentences. (Of course, it depends on the interpretation, but usually, there one 
in mind.) Among the well-formed strings occur the theorems. The: are defined by an 
axiom schema, and a rule of production. My goal in inventing the pq-system was to 
imitate additions: I wanted every theorem] to express a true addition under interpretation; 
conversely, I wanted every true addition of precisely two positive integers to be 
translatable into a string, which would be a theorem. That goal was achieved. Notice, 
then fore, that all false additions, such as "2 plus 3 equals 6", are mapped into strings 
which are well-formed, but which are not theorems. 



Formal Systems and Reality 

This is our first example of 'a case where a formal system is based upon portion of 
reality, and seems to mimic it perfectly, in that its theorems a] isomorphic to truths about 
that part of reality. However, reality and tt formal system are independent. Nobody need 
be aware that there is a isomorphism between the two. Each side stands by itself-one plus 
or equals two, whether or not we know that -p-q~ is a theorem; and -p-q~ is still a 
theorem whether or not we connect it with addition. 

You might wonder whether making this formal system, or any form system, sheds 
new light on truths in the domain of its interpretation. Hat we learned any new additions 
by producing pq-theorems? Certainly not but we have learned something about the nature 
of addition as process-namely, that it is easily mimicked by a typographical rule 
governing meaningless symbols. This still should not be a big surprise sing addition is 
such a simple concept. It is a commonplace that addition can I captured in the spinning 
gears of a device like a cash register. 

But it is clear that we have hardly scratched the surface, as far formal systems go; 
it is natural to wonder about what portion of reality co be imitated in its behavior by a set 
of meaningless symbols governed I formal rules. Can all of reality be turned into a formal 
system? In a very broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes. One could suggest, for 
instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



61 



system. Its symbols do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-dimensional 
vacuum (space); they are the elementary particles of which everything is composed. 
(Tacit assumption: that there is an end to the descending chain of matter, so that the 
expression "elementary particles" makes sense.) The "typographical rules" are the laws of 
physics, which tell how, given the positions and velocities of all particles at a given 
instant, to modify them, resulting in a new set of positions and velocities belonging to the 
"next" instant. So the theorems of this grand formal system are the possible 
configurations of particles at different times in the history of the universe. The sole axiom 
is (or perhaps, was) the original configuration of all the particles at the "beginning of 
time". This is so grandiose a conception, however, that it has only the most theoretical 
interest; and besides, quantum mechanics (and other parts of physics) casts at least some 
doubt on even the theoretical worth of this idea. Basically, we are asking if the universe 
operates deterministically, which is an open question. 

Mathematics and Symbol Manipulation 

Instead of dealing with such a big picture, let's limit ourselves to mathematics as 
our "real world". Here, a serious question arises: How can we be sure, if we've tried to 
model a formal system on some part of mathematics, that we've done the job accurately- 
especially if we're not one hundred per cent familiar with that portion of mathematics 
already? Suppose the goal of the formal system is to bring us new knowledge in that 
discipline. How will we know that the interpretation of every theorem is true, unless 
we've proven that the isomorphism is perfect? And how will we prove that the 
isomorphism is perfect, if we don't already know all about the truths in the discipline to 
begin with? 

Suppose that in an excavation somewhere, we actually did discover some 
mysterious formal system. We would try out various interpretations and perhaps 
eventually hit upon one which seemed to make every theorem come out true, and every 
nontheorem come out false. But this is something which we could only check directly in 
a finite number of cases. The set of theorems is most likely infinite. How will we know 
that all theorems express truths under this interpretation, unless we know everything there 
is to know about both the formal system and the corresponding domain of interpretation? 

It is in somewhat this odd position that we will find ourselves when we attempt to 
match the reality of natural numbers (i.e., the nonnegative integers: 0, 1, 2, ...) with the 
typographical symbols of a formal system. We will try to understand the relationship 
between what we call "truth" in number theory and what we can get at by symbol 
manipulation. 

So let us briefly look at the basis for calling some statements of number theory 
true, and others false. How much is 12 times 12? Everyone knows it is 144. But how 
many of the people who give that answer have actually at 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



62 



any time in their lives drawn a 12 by 12 rectangle, and then counted the little squares in 
it? Most people would regard the drawing and counting unnecessary. They would instead 
offer as proof a few marks on paper, such as are shown below: 

12 
X 12 



24 
12 



144 



And that would be the "proof. Nearly everyone believes that if you counted the 
squares, you would get 144 of them; few people feel that outcome is in doubt. 

The conflict between the two points of view comes into sharper focus when you 
consider the problem of determining the value 987654321 x 123456789. First of all, it is 
virtually impossible to construct the appropriate rectangle; and what is worse, even if it 
were constructed and huge armies of people spent centuries counting the little squares, o 
a very gullible person would be willing to believe their final answer. It is just too likely 
that somewhere, somehow, somebody bobbled just a little bit. So is it ever possible to 
know what the answer is? If you trust the symbolic process which involves manipulating 
digits according to certain simple rules, yes. That process is presented to children as a 
device which gets right answer; lost in the shuffle, for many children, are the rhyme 
reason of that process. The digit-shunting laws for multiplication are based mostly on a 
few properties of addition and multiplication which are assumed to hold for all numbers. 

The Basic Laws of Arithmetic 

The kind of assumption I mean is illustrated below. Suppose that you down a few sticks: 

I II II II I I 

Now you count them. At the same time, somebody else counts them, starting from the 
other end. Is it clear that the two of you will get the s: answer? The result of a counting 
process is independent of the way in which it is done. This is really an assumption about 
what counting i would be senseless to try to prove it, because it is so basic; either you s or 
you don't-but in the latter case, a proof won't help you a bit. 

From this kind of assumption, one can get to the commutativity and associativity 
of addition (i.e., first that b + c = c + b always, and second that b + (c + d) = (b + c) + d 
always). The same assumption can also you to the commutativity and associativity of 
multiplication; just think of 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



63 



many cubes assembled to form a large rectangular solid. Multiplicative commutativity 
and associativity are just the assumptions that when you rotate the solid in various ways, 
the number of cubes will not change. Now these assumptions are not verifiable in all 
possible cases, because the number of such cases is infinite. We take them for granted; 
we believe them (if we ever think about them) as deeply as we could believe anything. 
The amount of money in our pocket will not change as we walk down the street, jostling 
it up and down; the number of books we have will not change if we pack them up in a 
box, load them into our car, drive one hundred miles, unload the box, unpack it, and place 
the books in a new shelf. All of this is part of what we mean by number. 

There are certain types of people who, as soon as some undeniable fact is written 
down, find it amusing to show why that "fact" is false after all. I am such a person, and as 
soon as I had written down the examples above involving sticks, money, and books, I 
invented situations in which they were wrong. You may have done the same. It goes to 
show that numbers as abstractions are really quite different from the everyday numbers 
which we use. 

People enjoy inventing slogans which violate basic arithmetic but which illustrate 
"deeper" truths, such as "1 and 1 make 1" (for lovers), or "1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 1" (the 
Trinity). You can easily pick holes in those slogans, showing why, for instance, using the 
plus-sign is inappropriate in both cases. But such cases proliferate. Two raindrops 
running down a windowpane merge; does one plus one make one? A cloud breaks up into 
two clouds-more evidence for the same? It is not at all easy to draw a sharp line between 
cases where what is happening could be called "addition", and where some other word is 
wanted. If you think about the question, you will probably come up with some criterion 
involving separation of the objects in space, and making sure each one is clearly 
distinguishable from all the others. But then how could one count ideas? Or the number 
of gases comprising the atmosphere? Somewhere, if you try to look it up, you can 
probably find a statement such as, "There are 17 languages in India, and 462 dialects." 
There is something strange about precise statements like that, when the concepts 
"language" and "dialect" are themselves fuzzy. 

Ideal Numbers 

Numbers as realities misbehave. However, there is an ancient and innate sense in 
people that numbers ought not to misbehave. There is something clean and pure in the 
abstract notion of number, removed from counting beads, dialects, or clouds; and there 
ought to be a way of talking about numbers without always having the silliness of reality 
come in and intrude. The hard-edged rules that govern "ideal" numbers constitute 
arithmetic, and their more advanced consequences constitute number theory. There is 
only one relevant question to be asked, in making the transition from numbers as 
practical things to numbers as formal things. Once you have 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



64 




Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



65 



decided to try to capsulize all of number theory in an ideal system, is it really possible to 
do the job completely? Are numbers so clean and crystalline and regular that their nature 
can be completely captured in the rules of a formal system? The picture Liberation (Fig. 
13), one of Escher's most beautiful, is a marvelous contrast between the formal and the 
informal, with a fascinating transition region. Are numbers really as free as birds? Do 
they suffer as much from being crystallized into a rule-obeying system? Is there a 
magical transition region between numbers in reality and numbers on paper? 

When I speak of the properties of natural numbers, I don't just mean properties 
such as the sum of a particular pair of integers. That can be found out by counting, and 
anybody who has grown up in this century cannot doubt the mechanizability of such 
processes as counting, adding, multiplying, and so on. I mean the kinds of properties 
which mathematicians are interested in exploring, questions for which no counting- 
process is sufficient to provide the answer-not even theoretically sufficient. Let us take a 
classic example of such a property of natural numbers. The statement is: "There are 
infinitely many prime numbers." First of all, there is no counting process which will ever 
be able to confirm, or refute, this assertion. The best we could do would be to count 
primes for a while and concede that there are "a lot". But no amount of counting alone 
would ever resolve the question of whether the number of primes is finite or infinite. 
There could always be more. The statement-and it is called "Euclid's Theorem" (notice 
the capital "T")-is quite unobvious. It may seem reasonable, or appealing, but it is not 
obvious. However, mathematicians since Euclid have always called it true. What is the 
reason? 

Euclid's Proof 

The reason is that reasoning tells them it is so. Let us follow the reasoning involved. We 
will look at a variant of Euclid's proof. This proof works by showing that whatever 
number you pick, there is a prime larger than it. Pick a number-N. Multiply all the 
positive integers starting with 1 and ending with N; in other words, form the factorial of 
N, written "N!". What you get is divisible by every number up to N. When you add 1 to 
N!, the result 

can't be a multiple of 2 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide 

by 2); 

can't be a multiple of 3 (because it leaves I over, when you divide 

by 3); 

can't be a multiple of 4 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide 

by 4); 



Meaning and Form in Mathematics 



66 



can't be a multiple of A" (because it leaves 1 over, when you 

divide by AO; 

In other words, N\ + 1 , if it is divisible at all (other than by 1 and itself only is 
divisible by numbers greater than N. So either it is itself prime, or prime divisors are 
greater than N. But in either case we've shown the must exist a prime above N. The 
process holds no matter what number is. Whatever N is, there is a prime greater than N. 
And thus ends the demonstration of the infinitude of the primes. 

This last step, incidentally, is called generalization, and we will meet again later 
in a more formal context. It is where we phrase an argument terms of a single number 
(AO, and then point out that A" was unspecified and therefore the argument is a general 
one. 

Euclid's proof is typical of what constitutes "real mathematics". It simple, 
compelling, and beautiful. It illustrates that by taking several rash short steps one can get 
a long way from one's starting point. In our case, t starting points are basic ideas about 
multiplication and division and forth. The short steps are the steps of reasoning. And 
though eve individual step of the reasoning seems obvious, the end result is not obvious. 
We can never check directly whether the statement is true or not; } we believe it, because 
we believe in reasoning. If you accept reasoning there seems to be no escape route; once 
you agree to hear Euclid out, you'll have to agree with his conclusion. That's most 
fortunate-because it mea that mathematicians will always agree on what statements to 
label "true and what statements to label "false". 

This proof exemplifies an orderly thought process. Each statement related to 
previous ones in an irresistible way. This is why it is called "proof rather than just "good 
evidence". In mathematics the goal always to give an ironclad proof for some unobvious 
statement. The very fact of the steps being linked together in an ironclad way suggests ti 
there may be a patterned structure binding these statements together. TI structure can 
best be exposed by finding a new vocabulary-a stylized vocabulary, consisting of 
symbols-suitable only for expressing statements about numbers. Then we can look at the 
proof as it exists in its translated version. It will be a set of statements which are related, 
line by line, in some detectable way. But the statements, since they're represented by 
means a small and stylized set of symbols, take on the aspect of patterns. In other words, 
though when read aloud, they seem to be statements about numb and their properties, still 
when looked at on paper, they seem to be abstract patterns-and the line-by-line structure 
of the proof may start to look like slow transformation of patterns according to some few

Getting Around Infinity 

Although Euclid's proof is a proof that all numbers have a certain property it avoids 
treating each of the infinitely many cases separately. It gets around

it by using phrases like "whatever TV is", or "no matter what number TV is". We could also 
phrase-the proof over again, so that it uses the phrase "all N". By knowing the appropriate 
context and correct ways of using such phrases, we never have to deal with infinitely 
many statements. We deal with just two or three concepts, such as the word "all" -which, 
though themselves finite, embody an infinitude; and by using them, we sidestep the 
apparent problem that there are an infinite number of facts we want to prove. 

We use the word "all" in a few ways which are defined by the thought processes 
of reasoning. That is, there are rules which our usage of "all" obeys. We may be 
unconscious of them, and tend to claim we operate on the basis of the meaning of the 
word; but that, after all, is only a circumlocution for saying that we are guided by rules 
which we never make explicit. We have used words all our lives in certain patterns, and 
instead of calling the patterns "rules", we attribute the courses of our thought processes to 
the "meanings" of words. That discovery was a crucial recognition in the long path 
towards the formalization of number theory. 

If we were to delve into Euclid's proof more and more carefully, we would see 
that it is composed of many, many small-almost infinitesimal steps. If all those steps were 
written out line after line, the proof would appear incredibly complicated. To our minds it 
is clearest when several steps are telescoped together, to form one single sentence. If we 
tried to look at the proof in slow motion, we would begin to discern individual frames. In 
other words, the dissection can go only so far, and then we hit the "atomic" nature of 
reasoning processes. A proof can be broken down into a series of tiny but discontinuous 
jumps which seem to flow smoothly when perceived from a higher vantage point. In 
Chapter VIII, I will show one way of breaking the proof into atomic units, and you will 
see how incredibly many steps are involved. Perhaps it should not surprise you, though. 
The operations in Euclid's brain when he invented the proof must have involved millions 
of neurons (nerve cells), many of which fired several hundred times in a single second. 
The mere utterance of a sentence involves hundreds of thousands of neurons. If Euclid's 
thoughts were that complicated, it makes sense for his proof to contain a huge number of 
steps! (There may be little direct connection between the neural actions in his brain, and a 
proof in our formal system, but the complexities of the two are comparable. It is as if 
nature wants the complexity of the proof of the infinitude of primes to be conserved, even 
when the systems involved are very different from each other.) 

In Chapters to come, we will lay out a formal system that (1) includes a stylized 
vocabulary in which all statements about natural numbers can be expressed, and (2) has 
rules corresponding to all the types of reasoning which seem necessary. A very important 
question will be whether the rules for symbol manipulation which we have then 
formulated are really of equal power (as far as number theory is concerned) to our usual 
mental reasoning abilities-or, more generally, whether it is theoretically possible to attain 
the level of our thinking abilities, by using some formal system.

The telephone rings; Achilles picks it up. 

Achilles: Hello, this is Achilles. 
Achilles: Oh, hello, Mr. T. How are you? 

Achilles: A torticollis? Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Do you have any idea what caused it? 
Achilles: How long did you hold it in that position? 

Achilles: Well, no wonder it's stiff, then. What on earth induced you keep your neck 

twisted that way for so long? 
Achilles: Wondrous many of them, eh? What kinds, for example? Achilles: What do you 

mean, "phantasmagorical beasts"?

Achilles: Oh, well, it's all the same to me. 

Achilles: You're right; I wonder why I never noticed that difference between fiddles and 
guitars before. Speaking of fiddling, how would you like to come over and listen 
to one of the sonatas for unaccompanied violin by your favorite composer, J. S. 
Bach? I just bought a marvelous recording of them. I still can't get over the way 
Bach uses a single violin to create a piece with such interest. 

Achilles: A headache too? That's a shame. Perhaps you should just go to bed. 

Achilles: I see. Have you tried counting sheep? 

Achilles: Oh, oh, I see. Yes, I fully know what you mean. Well, if it's THAT distracting, 

perhaps you'd better tell it to me, and let me try to work on it, too. 
Achilles: A word with the letters 'A', 'D', 'A', "C consecutively inside it ... Hmm ... 

What about "abracadabra"? 
Achilles: True, "ADAC" occurs backwards, not forwards, in that word. Achilles: Hours 

and hours? It sounds like I'm in for a long puzzle, then. Where did you hear this 

infernal riddle? 

Achilles: You mean he looked like he was meditating on esoteric Buddhist matters, but in 
reality he was just trying to think up complex word puzzles? 

Achilles: Aha! -the snail knew what this fellow was up to. But how did you come to talk 
to the snail? 

Achilles: Say, I once heard a word puzzle a little bit like this one. Do you want to hear it? 
Or would it just drive you further into distraction? Achilles: I agree-can't do any 
harm. Here it is: What's a word that begins with the letters "HE" and also ends 
with "HE"? 

Achilles: Very ingenious-but that's almost cheating. It's certainly not what I meant! 
Achilles: Of course you're right-it fulfills the conditions, but it's a sort of "degenerate" 

solution. There's another solution which I had in mind. Achilles: That's exactly it! 

How did you come up with it so fast? Achilles: So here's a case where having a 

headache actually might have helped you, rather than hindering you. Excellent! 

But I'm still in the dark on your "ADAC" puzzle. 
Achilles: Congratulations! Now maybe you'll be able to get to sleep! So tell me, what is 

the solution? 

Achilles: Well, normally I don't like hints, but all right. What's your hint? Achilles: I 
don't know what you mean by "figure" and "ground" in this case. 

Achilles: Certainly I know Mosaic II! I know ALL of Escher's works. After all, he's my 
favorite artist. In any case, I've got a print of Mosaic II hanging on my wall, in 
plain view from here.

CHAPTER III 



Figure and Ground 

Primes vs. Composites 

THERE IS A strangeness to the idea that concepts can be captured by simple 
typographical manipulations. The one concept so far captured is that of addition, and it 
may not have appeared very strange. But suppose the goal were to create a formal system 
with theorems of the form Px, the letter V standing for a hyphen-string, and where the 
only such theorems would be ones in which the hyphen-string contained exactly a prime 
number of hyphens. Thus, P — would be a theorem, but P — would not. How could this 
be done typographically? First, it is important to specify clearly what is meant by 
typographical operations. The complete repertoire has been presented in the MlU-system 
and the pq-system, so we really only need to make a list of the kinds of things we have 
permitted: 

(1) reading and recognizing any of a finite set of symbols; 

(2) writing down any symbol belonging to that set; 

(3) copying any of those symbols from one place to another; 

(4) erasing any of those symbols; 

(5) checking to see whether one symbol is the same as another; 

(6) keeping and using a list of previously generated theorems. 

The list is a little redundant, but no matter. What is important is that it clearly involves 
only trivial abilities, each of them far less than the ability to distinguish primes from 
nonprimes. How, then, could we compound some of these operations to make a formal 
system in which primes are distinguished from composite numbers? 

The tq-System 

A first step might be to try to solve a simpler, but related, problem. We could try to make 
a system similar to the pq-system, except that it represents multiplication, instead of 
addition. Let's call it the tq-system, Y for times'. More specifically, suppose X, Y, and Z 
are, respectively, the numbers of hyphens in the hyphen-strings x, y, and z. (Notice I am 
taking special pains to distinguish between a string and the number of hyphens it 
contains.) Then we wish the string x ty q z to be a theorem if and only if X times Y 

equals Z. For instance, — t — q should be a theorem because 2 times 3 equals 6, but — 

t~q — should not be a theorem. The tq-system can be characterized just about as easily as 
the pq-system namely, by using just one axiom schema and one rule of inference: 



Figure and Ground 



72 



AXIOM SCHEMA: xt-qx is an axiom, whenever x is a hyphen string. 

RULE OF INFERENCE: Suppose that x, y, and z are all hyphen-strings. An suppose that 
x ty qz is an old theorem. Then, xty-qzx is a ne' theorem. 

Below is the derivation of the theorem — t — q 



Notice how the middle hyphen-string grows by one hyphen each time the rule of 
inference is applied; so it is predictable that if you want a theorem with ten hyphens in 
the middle, you apply the rule of inference nine times in a row. 



Multiplication, a slightly trickier concept than addition, has now bee] "captured" 
typographically, like the birds in Escher's Liberation. What about primeness? Here's a 
plan that might seem smart: using the tq-system define a new set of theorems of the form 
Cx, which characterize compost, numbers, as follows: 

RULE: Suppose x, y, and z are hyphen-strings. If x-ty-qz is a theorem then C z is a 
theorem. 

This works by saying that Z (the number of hyphens in z) is composite a long as it is the 
product of two numbers greater than 1 -namely, X + (the number of hyphens in x-), and Y 
+ 1 (the number of hyphens in y I am defending this new rule by giving you some 
"Intelligent mode justifications for it. That is because you are a human being, and want t, 
know why there is such a rule. If you were operating exclusively in the "Mechanical 
mode", you would not need any justification, since M-mod. workers just follow the rules 
mechanically and happily, never questioning; them! 

Because you work in the I-mode, you will tend to blur in your mind the 
distinction between strings and their interpretations. You see, things Cal become quite 
confusing as soon as you perceive "meaning" in the symbol which you are manipulating. 
You have to fight your own self to keep from thinking that the string'—' is the number 3. 
The Requirement of Formality, which in Chapter I probably seemed puzzling (because it 
seemed so obvious), here becomes tricky, and crucial. It is the essential thing which 
keeps you from mixing up the I-mode with the M-mode; or said another way, it keeps 
you from mixing up arithmetical facts with typographical theorems.

Capturing Compositeness 



Illegally Characterizing Primes 



It is very tempting to jump from the C-type theorems directly to P-type theorems, by 
proposing a rule of the following kind: 

PROPOSED RULE: Suppose x is a hyphen-string. If Cx is not a theorem, then Px is a 
theorem. 

The fatal flaw here is that checking whether Cx is not a theorem is not an explicitly 
typographical operation. To know for sure that MU is not a theorem of the MlU-system, 
you have to go outside of the system ... and so it is with this Proposed Rule. It is a rule 
which violates the whole idea of formal systems, in that it asks you to operate informally- 
that is, outside the system. Typographical operation (6) allows you to look into the 
stockpile of previously found theorems, but this Proposed Rule is asking you to look into 
a hypothetical "Table of Nontheorems". But in order to generate such a table, you would 
have to do some reasoning outside the .system-reasoning which shows why various strings 
cannot be generated inside the system. Now it may well be that there is another formal 
system which can generate the "Table of Nontheorems", by purely typographical means. 
In fact, our aim is to find just such a system. But the Proposed Rule is not a typographical 
rule, and must be dropped. 

This is such an important point that we might dwell on it a bit more. In our C- 
system (which includes the tq-system and the rule which defines C-type theorems), we 
have theorems of the form Cx, with V standing, as usual, for a hyphen-string. There are 
also nontheorems of the form Cx. (These are what I mean when I refer to "nontheorems", 
although of course tt-Cqq and other ill-formed messes are also nontheorems.) The 
difference is that theorems have a composite number of hyphens, nontheorems have a 
prime number of hyphens. Now the theorems all have a common "form", that is, originate 
from a common set of typographical rules. Do all nontheorems also have a common 
"form", in the same sense? Below is a list of C-type theorems, shown without their 
derivations. The parenthesized numbers following them simply count the hyphens in 
them.

I he "holes" in this list are the nontheorems. I o repeat the earlier quest Do the holes also 
have some "form" in common? Would it be reasonable say that merely by virtue of being 
the holes in this list, they share a common form? Yes and no. That they share some 
typographical quality is and able, but whether we want to call it "form" is unclear. The 
reason hesitating is that the holes are only negatively defined-they are the things that are 
left out of a list which is positively defined. 

Figure and Ground 

This recalls the famous artistic distinction between figure and ground. When a figure or 
"positive space" (e.g., a human form, or a letter, or a still life is drawn inside a frame, an 
unavoidable consequence is that its complementary shape-also called the "ground", or 
"background", or "negative space"-has also been drawn. In most drawings, however, this 
fig ground relationship plays little role. The artist is much less interested in ground than 
in the figure. But sometimes, an artist will take interest in ground as well. 

There are beautiful alphabets which play with this figure-ground distinction. A 
message written in such an alphabet is shown below. At fir looks like a collection of 
somewhat random blobs, but if you step back ways and stare at it for a while, all of a 
sudden, you will see seven letters appear in this .. 




FIGURE 15. 



For a similar effect, take a look at my drawing Smoke Signal (Fig. 139). Along these 
lines, you might consider this puzzle: can you somehow create a drawing containing 
words in both the figure and the ground? 

Let us now officially distinguish between two kinds of figures: cursively 
drawable ones, and recursive ones (by the way, these are my own terms are not in 
common usage). A cursively drawable figure is one whose ground is merely an 
accidental by-product of the drawing act. A recursive figure is one whose ground can be 
seen as a figure in its own right. Usually this is quite deliberate on the part of the artist. 
The "re" in "recursive" represents the fact that both foreground and background are 
cursively drawable - the figure is "twice-cursive". Each figure-ground boundary in a 
recursive figure is a double-edged sword. M. C. Escher was a master at drawing recursive 
figures-see, for instance, his beautiful recursive drawing of birds (Fig. 16). 



Figure and Ground 



75 



FIGURE 16. Tiling of the plane using birds, by M. C. Escher (from a 1942 notebook). 

Our distinction is not as rigorous as one in mathematics, for who can definitively 
say that a particular ground is not a figure? Once pointed out, almost any ground has 
interest of its own. In that sense, every figure is recursive. But that is not what I intended 
by the term. There is a natural and intuitive notion of recognizable forms. Are both the 
foreground and background recognizable forms? If so, then the drawing is recursive. If 
you look at the grounds of most line drawings, you will find them rather unrecognizable. 
This demonstrates that 

There exist recognizable forms whose negative space is not any recognizable form. 

In more "technical" terminology, this becomes: 

There exist cursively drawable figures which are not recursive. 

Scott Kim's solution to the above puzzle, which I call his "FIGURE-FIGURE 
Figure", is shown in Figure 17. If you read both black and white,

76

Figure and Ground 



you will see "FIGURE" everywhere, but "GROUND" nowhere! It is a paragon of 
recursive figures. In this clever drawing, there are two nonequivalent ways of 
characterizing the black regions: 

(1) as the negative space to the white regions; 

(2) as altered copies of the white regions (produced by coloring and shifting each 

white region). 

(In the special case of the FIGURE-FIGURE Figure, the two characterizations are 
equivalent-but in most black-and-white pictures, they would not be.) Now in Chapter 
VIII, when we create our Typographical Number Theory (TNT), it will be our hope that 
the set of all false statements of number theory can be characterized in two analogous 
ways: 

(1) as the negative space to the set of all TNT-theorems; 

(2) as altered copies of the set of all TNT-theorems (produced by negating each 

TNT-theorem). 

But this hope will be dashed, because: 

(1) inside the set of all nontheorems are found some truths 

(2) outside the set of all negated theorems are found some falsehoods 

You will see why and how this happens, in Chapter XIV. Meanwhile, ponder over a 
pictorial representation of the situation (Fig. 18). 

Figure and Ground in Music 

One may also look for figures and grounds in music. One analogue is the distinction 
between melody and accompaniment-for the melody is always in the forefront of our 
attention, and the accompaniment is subsidiary, in some sense. Therefore it is surprising 
when we find, in the lower lines of a piece of music, recognizable melodies. This does 
not happen too often in post-baroque music. Usually the harmonies are not thought of as 
foreground. But in baroque music-in Bach above all-the distinct lines, whether high or 
low or in between, all act as "figures". In this sense, pieces by Bach can be called 
"recursive". 

Another figure-ground distinction exists in music: that between on-beat and off- 
beat. If you count notes in a measure "one-and, two-and, three-and, four-and", most 
melody-notes will come on numbers, not on "and"'s. But sometimes, a melody will be 
deliberately pushed onto the "and" 's, for the sheer effect of it. This occurs in several 
etudes for the piano by Chopin, for instance. It also occurs in Bach-particularly in his 
Sonatas and Partitas for unaccompanied violin, and his Suites for unaccompanied cello. 
There, Bach manages to get two or more musical lines going simultaneously. Sometimes 
he does this by having the solo instrument play "double stops"-two notes at once. Other 
times, however, he

meandering coastline which, no matter how closely you examine it, always has finer 
levels of structure, an consequently impossible to describe exactly in any finite way. (See

puts one voice on the on-beats, and the other voice on the off-beats, so ear separates them 
and hears two distinct melodies weaving in and out, - harmonizing with each other. 
Needless to say, Bach didn't stop at this level of complexity... 

Recursively Enumerable Sets vs. Recursive Sets 

Now let us carry back the notions of figure and ground to the domain formal 
systems. In our example, the role of positive space is played by C-type theorems, and the 
role of negative space is played by strings with a 



Figure and Ground 



79 



prime number of hyphens. So far, the only way we have found to represent prime 
numbers typographically is as a negative space. Is there, however, some way-I don't care 
how complicated-of representing the primes as a positive space-that is, as a set of 
theorems of some formal system? 

Different people's intuitions give different answers here. I remember quite vividly 
how puzzled and intrigued I was upon realizing the difference between a positive 
characterization and a negative characterization. I was quite convinced that not only the 
primes, but any set of numbers which could be represented negatively, could also be 
represented positively. The intuition underlying my belief is represented by the question: 
"How could a figure and its ground not carry exactly the same information!" They 
seemed to me to embody the same information, just coded in two complementary ways. 
What seems right to you? 

It turns out I was right about the primes, but wrong in general. This astonished 
me, and continues to astonish me even today. It is a fact that: 

There exist formal systems whose negative space (set of nontheorems) is not 
the positive space (set of theorems) of any formal system. 

This result, it turns out, is of depth equal to Godel's Theorem-so it is not 
surprising that my intuition was upset. I, just like the mathematicians of the early 
twentieth century, expected the world of formal systems and natural numbers to be more 
predictable than it is. In more technical terminology, this becomes: 

There exist recursively enumerable sets which are not recursive. 

The phrase recursively enumerable (often abbreviated "r.e.") is the mathematical 
counterpart to our artistic notion of "cursively drawable"-and recursive is the counterpart 
of "recursive". For a set of strings to be "r.e." means that it can be generated according to 
typographical rules-for example, the set of C-type theorems, the set of theorems of the 
MlU-system-indeed, the set of theorems of any formal system. This could be compared 
with the conception of a "figure" as "a set of lines which can be generated according to 
artistic rules" (whatever that might mean!). And a "recursive set" is like a figure whose 
ground is also a figure-not only is it r.e., but its complement is also r.e. 
It follows from the above result that: 

There exist formal systems for which there is no typographical decision 
procedure. 

How does this follow? Very simply. A typographical decision procedure is a 
method which tells theorems from nontheorems. The existence of such a test allows us to 
generate all nontheorems systematically, simply by going down a list of all strings and 
performing the test on them one at a time, discarding ill-formed strings and theorems 
along the way. This amounts to 



Figure and Ground 



80 



a typographical method for generating the set of nontheorems. But according to the 
earlier statement (which we here accept on faith), for some systems this is not possible. 
So we must conclude that typographical decision procedures do not exist for all formal 
systems. 

Suppose we found a set F of natural numbers (\P for 'Figure') whi4 we could 
generate in some formal way-like the composite numbers. Suppose its complement is the 
set G (for 'Ground')-like the primes. Together F and G make up all the natural numbers, 
and we know a rule for making all the numbers in set F, but we know no such rule for 
making all tl numbers in set G. It is important to understand that if the members of were 
always generated in order of increasing size, then we could always characterize G. The 
problem is that many r.e. sets are generated I methods which throw in elements in an 
arbitrary order, so you never know if a number which has been skipped over for a long 
time will get included you just wait a little longer. 

We answered no to the artistic question, "Are all figures recursive We have now 
seen that we must likewise answer no to the analogous question in mathematics: "Are all 
sets recursive?" With this perspective, 1 us now come back to the elusive word "form". 
Let us take our figure-set and our ground-set G again. We can agree that all the numbers 
in set have some common "form"-but can the same be said about numbers in s G? It is a 
strange question. When we are dealing with an infinite set to sta with-the natural 
numbers-the holes created by removing some subs may be very hard to define in any 
explicit way. And so it may be that th< are not connected by any common attribute or 
"form". In the last analysis it is a matter of taste whether you want to use the word 
"form"-but just thinking about it is provocative. Perhaps it is best not to define "form", bi 
to leave it with some intuitive fluidity. 

Here is a puzzle to think about in connection with the above matter Can you 
characterize the following set of integers (or its negative space) 

1 3 7 12 18 26 35 45 56 69... 

How is this sequence like the FIGURE -FIGURE Figure? 

Primes as Figure Rather than Ground 

Finally, what about a formal system for generating primes? How is it don< The trick is to 
skip right over multiplication, and to go directly to nondivisibility as the thing to 
represent positively. Here are an axiom schema and rule for producing theorems which 
represent the notion that one number does not divide (D N D) another number exactly: 

AXIOM SCHEMA: xy D N Dx where x and y are hyphen-strings. 

For example — D N D~, where x has been replaced by'~'and y by ' — ". 



Figure and Ground 



81 



RULE: If x D N Dy is a theorem, then so is x D N Dx y. 

If you use the rule twice, you can generate this theorem: 

D N D 

which is interpreted as "5 does not divide 12". But — D N D is not a theorem. 

What goes wrong if you try to produce it? 

Now in order to determine that a given number is prime, we have to build up 
some knowledge about its nondivisibility properties. In particular, we want to know that 
it is not divisible by 2 or 3 or 4, etc., all the way up to 1 less than the number itself. But 
we can't be so vague in formal systems as to say "et cetera". We must spell things out. 
We would like to have a way of saying, in the language of the system, "the number Z is 
divisor free up to X", meaning that no number between 2 and X divides Z. This can be 
done, but there is a trick to it. Think about it if you want. 

Here is the solution: 

RULE: If -D N D z is a theorem, so is z D F-. 

RULE: If z D Fx is a theorem and also x-D N Dz is a theorem, z D Fx- is a theorem. 

These two rules capture the notion of divisor freeness. All we need to do is to say that 
primes are numbers which are divisor-free up to 1 less than themselves: 

RULE: If z-DFz is a theorem, then Pz- is a theorem. 

Oh-let's not forget that 2 is prime! 

Axiom: P~. 

And there you have it. The principle of representing primality formally is that there is a 
test for divisibility which can be done without any backtracking. You march steadily 
upward, testing first for divisibility by 2, then by 3, and so on. It is this "monotonicity" or 
unidirectionality-this absence of cross-play between lengthening and shortening, 
increasing and decreasing-that allows primality to be captured. And it is this potential 
complexity of formal systems to involve arbitrary amounts of backwards-forwards 
interference that is responsible for such limitative results as Godel's Theorem, Turing's 
Halting Problem, and the fact that not all recursively enumerable sets are recursive.

Contracrostipunctus 

Achilles has come to visit his friend and jogging companion, the 
Tortoise, at his home 

Achilles: Heavens, you certainly have an admirable boomerang collection 
Tortoise: Oh, pshaw. No better than that of any other Tortoise. And now would you like 
to step into the parlor? 

Achilles: Fine. {Walks to the corner of the room) I see you also have a large collection of 

records. What sort of music do you enjoy? 
Tortoise: Sebastian Bach isn't so bad, in my opinion. But these days, I must say, I am 

developing more and more of an interest in a rather specialized sort of music. 
Achilles: Tell me, what kind of music is that? 

Tortoise: A type of music which you are most unlikely to have heard of. call it "music to 

break phonographs by". 
Achilles: Did you say "to break phonographs by"? That is a curious concept. I can just 

see you, sledgehammer in hand, whacking on phonograph after another to pieces, 

to the strains of Beethoven's heroic masterpiece Wellington's Victory. 
Tortoise: That's not quite what this music is about. However, you might find its true 

nature just as intriguing. Perhaps I should give you a brief description of it? 
Achilles: Exactly what I was thinking. 

Tortoise: Relatively few people are acquainted with it. It all began whet my friend the 
Crab-have you met him, by the way?-paid m» a visit. 

Achilles: ' twould be a pleasure to make his acquaintance, I'm sure Though I've heard so 
much about him, I've never met him 

Tortoise: Sooner or later I'll get the two of you together. You'd hit it of splendidly. 
Perhaps we could meet at random in the park on day ... 

Achilles: Capital suggestion! I'll be looking forward to it. But you were going to tell me 
about your weird "music to smash phone graphs by", weren't you? 

Tortoise: Oh, yes. Well, you see, the Crab came over to visit one day. You must 
understand that he's always had a weakness for fang gadgets, and at that time he 
was quite an aficionado for, of al things, record players. He had just bought his 
first record player, and being somewhat gullible, believed every word the 
salesman had told him about it-in particular, that it was capable of reproducing 
any and all sounds. In short, he was convinced that it was a Perfect phonograph. 



Contracrostipunctus 



83 



Achilles: Naturally, I suppose you disagreed. 

Tortoise: True, but he would hear nothing of my arguments. He staunchly maintained that 
any sound whatever was reproducible on his machine. Since I couldn't convince 
him of the contrary, I left it at that. But not long after that, I returned the visit, 
taking with me a record of a song which I had myself composed. The song was 
called "I Cannot Be Played on Record Player 1". 

Achilles: Rather unusual. Was it a present for the Crab? 

Tortoise: Absolutely. I suggested that we listen to it on his new phonograph, and he was 
very glad to oblige me. So he put it on. But unfortunately, after only a few notes, 
the record player began vibrating rather severely, and then with a loud "pop", 
broke into a large number of fairly small pieces, scattered all about the room. The 
record was utterly destroyed also, needless to say. 

Achilles: Calamitous blow for the poor fellow, I'd say. What was the matter with his 
record player? 

Tortoise: Really, there was nothing the matter, nothing at all. It simply couldn't reproduce 

the sounds on the record which I had brought him, because they were sounds that 

would make it vibrate and break. 
Achilles: Odd, isn't it? I mean, I thought it was a Perfect phonograph. That's what the 

salesman had told him, after all. 
Tortoise: Surely, Achilles, you don't believe everything that salesmen tell you! Are you 

as naive as the Crab was? 
Achilles: The Crab was naiver by far! I know that salesmen are notorious prevaricators. I 

wasn't born yesterday! 

Tortoise: In that case, maybe you can imagine that this particular salesman had somewhat 
exaggerated the quality of the Crab's piece of equipment ... perhaps it was indeed 
less than Perfect, and could not reproduce every possible sound. 

Achilles: Perhaps that is an explanation. But there's no explanation for the amazing 
coincidence that your record had those very sounds on it ... 

Tortoise: Unless they got put there deliberately. You see, before returning the Crab's 
visit, I went to the store where the Crab had bought his machine, and inquired as 
to the make. Having ascertained that, I sent off to the manufacturers for a 
description of its design. After receiving that by return mail, I analyzed the entire 
construction of the phonograph and discovered a certain set of sounds which, if 
they were produced anywhere in the vicinity, would set the device to shaking and 
eventually to falling apart. 

Achilles: Nasty fellow! You needn't spell out for me the last details: that you recorded 
those sounds yourself, and offered the dastardly item as a gift ... 



Contracrostipunctus 



84 



Tortoise: Clever devil! You jumped ahead of the story! But that wasn't t end of the 
adventure, by any means, for the Crab did r believe that his record player was at 
fault. He was quite stubborn. So he went out and bought a new record player, this 
o even more expensive, and this time the salesman promised give him double his 
money back in case the Crab found a soul which it could not reproduce exactly. 
So the Crab told r excitedly about his new model, and I promised to come over 
and see it. 

Achilles: Tell me if I'm wrong-I bet that before you did so, you on again wrote the 
manufacturer, and composed and recorded new song called "I Cannot Be Played 
on Record Player based on the construction of the new model. 

Tortoise: Utterly brilliant deduction, Achilles. You've quite got the spirit. 

Achilles: So what happened this time? 

Tortoise: As you might expect, precisely the same thing. The phonograph fell into 
innumerable pieces, and the record was shattered. Achilles: Consequently, the 
Crab finally became convinced that there could be no such thing as a Perfect 
record player. 

Tortoise: Rather surprisingly, that's not quite what happened. He was sure that the next 
model up would fill the bill, and having twice the money, h e— 

Achilles: Oho-I have an idea! He could have easily outwitted you, I obtaining a LOW- 
fidelity phonograph-one that was not capable of reproducing the sounds which 
would destroy it. In that way, he would avoid your trick. 

Tortoise: Surely, but that would defeat the-original purpose-namely, to have a 
phonograph which could reproduce any sound whatsoever, even its own self- 
breaking sound, which is of coup impossible. 

Achilles: That's true. I see the dilemma now. If any record player-si 

Record Player X-is sufficiently high-fidelity, then when attempts to play the song "I 
Cannot Be Played on Record Player X", it will create just those vibrations which 
will cause to break. .. So it fails to be Perfect. And yet, the only way to g, around 
that trickery, namely for Record Player X to be c lower fidelity, even more 
directly ensures that it is not Perfect It seems that every record player is 
vulnerable to one or the other of these frailties, and hence all record players are 
defective. 

Tortoise: I don't see why you call them "defective". It is simply an inherent fact about 
record players that they can't do all that you might wish them to be able to do. But 
if there is a defect anywhere, is not in THEM, but in your expectations of what 
they should b able to do! And the Crab was just full of such unrealistic 
expectations. 



Contracrostipunctus 



85 



Achilles: Compassion for the Crab overwhelms me. High fidelity or low fidelity, he loses 
either way. 

Tortoise: And so, our little game went on like *_his for a few more rounds, and 
eventually our friend tried to become very smart. He got wind of the principle 
upon which I was basing my own records, and decided to try to outfox me. He 
wrote to the phonograph makers, and described a device of his own invention, 
which they built to specification. He called it "Record Player Omega". It was 
considerably more sophisticated than an ordinary record player. 

Achilles: Let me guess how: Did it have no of cotton? Or 

Tortoise: Let me tell you, instead. That will save some time. In the first place, Record 
Player Omega incorporated a television camera whose purpose it was to scan any 
record before playing it. This camera was hooked up to a small built-in computer, 
which would determine exactly the nature of the sounds, by looking at the groove- 
patterns. 

Achilles: Yes, so far so good. But what could Record Player Omega do with this 
information? 

Tortoise: By elaborate calculations, its little computer figured out what effects the sounds 
would have upon its phonograph. If it deduced that the sounds were such that they 
would cause the machine in its present configuration to break, then it did 
something very clever. Old Omega contained a device which could disassemble 
large parts of its phonograph subunit, and rebuild them in new ways, so that it 
could, in effect, change its own structure. If the sounds were "dangerous", a new 
configuration was chosen, one to which the sounds would pose no threat, and this 
new configuration would then be built by the rebuilding subunit, under direction 
of the little computer. Only after this rebuilding operation would Record Player 
Omega attempt to play the record. 

Achilles: Aha! That must have spelled the end of your tricks. I bet you were a little 
disappointed. 

Tortoise: Curious that you should think so ... I don't suppose that you know Godel's 

Incompleteness Theorem backwards and forwards, do you? 
Achilles: Know WHOSE Theorem backwards and forwards? I've 

heard of anything that sounds like that. I'm sure it's fascinating, but I'd rather hear more 
about "music to break records by". It's an amusing little story. Actually, I guess I 
can fill in the end. Obviously, there was no point in going on, and so you 
sheepishly admitted defeat, and that was that. Isn't that exactly it? 

Tortoise: What! It's almost midnight! I'm afraid it's my bedtime. I'd love to talk some 
more, but really I am growing quite sleepy. 



Contracrostipunctus 



86 



Achilles: As am 1 . Well, 1 u be on my way. (As he reaches the door, he suddenly stops, 
and turns around.) Oh, how silly of me! I almost forgo brought you a little 
present. Here. (Hands the Tortoise a small neatly wrapped package.) 

Tortoise: Really, you shouldn't have! Why, thank you very much indeed think I'll open it 
now. (Eagerly tears open the package, and ins discovers a glass goblet) Oh, what 
an exquisite goblet! Did y know that I am quite an aficionado for, of all things, gl 
goblets? 

Achilles: Didn't have the foggiest. What an agreeable coincidence! 

Tortoise: Say, if you can keep a secret, I'll let you in on something: I trying to find a 
Perfect goblet: one having no defects of a sort in its shape. Wouldn't it be 
something if this goblet-h call it "G"-were the one? Tell me, where did you come 
across Goblet G? 

Achilles: Sorry, but that's MY little secret. But you might like to know w its maker is. 
Tortoise: Pray tell, who is it? 

Achilles: Ever hear of the famous glassblower Johann Sebastian Bach? Well, he wasn't 
exactly famous for glassblowing-but he dabbled at the art as a hobby, though 
hardly a soul knows it-a: this goblet is the last piece he blew. 

Tortoise: Literally his last one? My gracious. If it truly was made by Bach its value is 
inestimable. But how are you sure of its maker 

Achilles: Look at the inscription on the inside-do you see where tletters 'B', 'A, C, "H 
have been etched? 

Tortoise: Sure enough! What an extraordinary thing. (Gently sets Goblet G down on a 
shelf.) By the way, did you know that each of the four letters in\Bach's name is 
the name of a musical note? 

Achilles:' tisn't possible, is it? After all, musical notes only go from 'A' through 'G. 

Tortoise: Just so; in most countries, that's the case. But in Germany, Bach's own 
homeland, the convention has always been similar, except that what we call 'B', 
they call 'H', and what we call 'B-flaf, they call 'B'. For instance, we talk about 
Bach's "Mass in B Minor whereas they talk about his "H-moll Messe". Is that 
clear? 

Achilles: ... hmm ... I guess so. It's a little confusing: H is B, and B B-flat. I suppose 
his name actually constitutes a melody, then 

Tortoise: Strange but true. In fact, he worked that melody subtly into or of his most 
elaborate musical pieces-namely, the final Contrapunctus in his Art of the Fugue. 
It was the last fugue Bach ever wrote. When I heard it for the first time, I had no 
idea how would end. Suddenly, without warning, it broke off. And the ... dead 
silence. I realized immediately that was where Bach died. It is an indescribably 
sad moment, and the effect it had o me was-shattering. In any case, B-A-C-H is 
the last theme c that fugue. It is hidden inside the piece. Bach didn't point it out

composer died. " (B-A-C-H in box.) I have let this final page of Bach 's last fugue serve as 
an epitaph.

Explicitly, but if you know about it, you can find it without much trouble. Ah, me-there 
are so many clever ways of hiding things in music .. . 

Achilles: . . or in poems. Poets used to do very similar things, you know (though it's 
rather out of style these days). For instance, Lewis Carroll often hid words and 
names in the first letters (or characters) of the successive lines in poems he wrote. 
Poems which conceal messages that way are called "acrostics". 

Tortoise: Bach, too, occasionally wrote acrostics, which isn't surprising. After all, 
counterpoint and acrostics, with their levels of hidden meaning, have quite a bit in 
common. Most acrostics, however, have only one hidden level-but there is no 
reason that one couldn't make a double-decker- an acrostic on top of an acrostic. 
Or one could make a "contracrostic"-where the initial letters, taken in reverse 
order, form a message. Heavens! There's no end to the possibilities inherent in the 
form. Moreover, it's not limited to poets; anyone could write acrostics-even a 
dialogician. 

Achilles: A dial-a-logician? That's a new one on me. 

Tortoise: Correction: I said "dialogician", by which I meant a writer of dialogues. Hmm 
... something just occurred to me. In the unlikely event that a dialogician should 
write a contrapuntal acrostic in homage to J. S. Bach, do you suppose it would be 
more proper for him to acrostically embed his OWN name-or that of Bach? Oh, 
well, why worry about such frivolous matters? Anybody who wanted to write 
such a piece could make up his own mind. Now getting back to Bach's melodic 
name, did you know that the melody B-A-C-H, if played upside down and 
backwards, is exactly the same as the original? 

Achilles: How can anything be played upside down? Backwards, I can see-you get H-C- 
A-B-but upside down? You must be pulling my leg. 

Tortoise: ' pon my word, you're quite a skeptic, aren't you? Well, I guess I'll have to give 
you a demonstration. Let me just go and fetch my fiddle- (Walks into the next 
room, and returns in a jiffy with an ancient-looking violin.) -and play it for you 
forwards and backwards and every which way. Let's see, now ... (Places his copy 
of the Art of the Fugue on his music stand and opens it to the last page.) ... here's 
the last Contrapunctus, and here's the last theme ... 

The Tortoise begins to play: B-A-C- - but as he bows the final H, suddenly, 
without warning, a shattering sound rudely interrupts his performance. Both 
he and Achilles spin around, just in time to catch a glimpse of myriad 
fragments of glass tinkling to the floor from the shelf where Goblet G had 
stood, only moments before. And then ... dead silence.

Chapter IV 



Consistency, Completeness, 
and Geometry 

Implicit and Explicit Meaning 

IN CHAPTER II, we saw how meaning-at least in the relatively simple context of formal 
systems-arises when there is an isomorphism between rule-governed symbols, and things 
in the real world. The more complex the isomorphism, in general, the more "equipment"- 
both hardware and software-is required to extract the meaning from the symbols. If an 
isomorphism is very simple (or very familiar), we are tempted to say that the meaning 
which it allows us to see is explicit. We see the meaning without seeing the isomorphism. 
The most blatant example is human language, where people often attribute meaning to 
words in themselves, without being in the slightest aware of the very complex 
"isomorphism" that imbues them with meanings. This is an easy enough error to make. It 
attributes all the meaning to the object (the word), rather than to the link between that 
object and the real world. You might compare it to the naive belief that noise is a 
necessary side effect of any collision of two objects. This is a false belief; if two objects 
collide in a vacuum, there will be no noise at all. Here again, the error stems from 
attributing the noise exclusively to the collision, and not recognizing the role of the 
medium, which carries it from the objects to the ear. 

Above, I used the word "isomorphism" in quotes to indicate that it must be taken 
with a grain of salt. The symbolic processes which underlie the understanding of human 
language are so much more complex than the symbolic processes in typical formal 
systems, that, if we want to continue thinking of meaning as mediated by isomorphisms, 
we shall have to adopt a far more flexible conception of what isomorphisms can be than 
we have up till now. In my opinion, in fact, the key element in answering the question 
"What is consciousness?" will be the unraveling of the nature of the "isomorphism" 
which underlies meaning. 

Explicit Meaning of the Contracrostipunctus 

All this is by way of preparation for a discussion of the Contracrostipunctus -a study in 
levels of meaning. The Dialogue has both explicit and implicit meanings. Its most 
explicit meaning is simply the story 



Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 



90 



Which was related. This "explicit meaning is, strictly speaking extremely implicit, in the 
sense that the brain processes required to understand the events in the story, given only 
the black marks on paper, are incredibly complex. Nevertheless, we shall consider the 
events in the story to be the explicit meaning of the Dialogue, and assume that every 
reader of English uses more or less the same "isomorphism" in sucking that meaning 
from the marks on the paper. 

Even so, I'd like to be a little more explicit about the explicit meaning of the story. 
First I'll talk about the record players and the records. The main point is that there are two 
levels of meaning for the grooves in the records. Level One is that of music. Now what is 
"music"-a sequence of vibrations in the air, or a succession of emotional responses in a 
brain? It is both. But before there can be emotional responses, there have to be vibrations. 
Now the vibrations get "pulled" out of the grooves by a record player, a relatively 
straightforward device; in fact you can do it with a pin, just pulling it down the grooves. 
After this stage, the ear converts the vibrations into firings of auditory neurons in the 
brain. Then ensue a number of stages in the brain, which gradually transform the linear 
sequence of vibrations into a complex pattern of interacting emotional responses-far too 
complex for us to go into here, much though I would like to. Let us therefore content 
ourselves with thinking of the sounds in the air as the "Level One" meaning of the 
grooves. 

What is the Level Two meaning of the grooves? It is the sequence of vibrations induced 
in the record player. This meaning can only arise after the Level One meaning has been 
pulled out of the grooves, since the vibrations in the air cause the vibrations in the 
phonograph. Therefore, the Level Two meaning depends upon a chain of two 
isomorphisms: 

(1) Isomorphism between arbitrary groove patterns and air 
vibrations; 

(2) Isomorphism between graph vibrations, arbitrary air 
vibrations and phonograph vibrations 

This chain of two isomorphisms is depicted in Figure 20. Notice that isomorphism I is the 
one which gives rise to the Level One meaning. The Level Two meaning is more implicit 
than the Level One meaning, because it is mediated by the chain of two isomorphisms. It 
is the Level Two meaning which "backfires", causing the record player to break apart. 
What is of interest is that the production of the Level One meaning forces the production 
of the Level Two meaning simultaneously-there is no way to have Level One without 
Level Two. So it was the implicit meaning of the record which turned back on it, and 
destroyed it. 

Similar comments apply to the goblet. One difference is that the mapping from 
letters of the alphabet to musical notes is one more level of isomorphism, which we could 
call "transcription". That is followed by "translation"-conversion of musical notes into 
musical sounds. Thereafter, the vibrations act back on the goblet just as they did on the 
escalating series of phonographs. 



Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 



91 




FIGURE 20. Visual rendition of the principle underlying Godel's Theorem: two back-to- 
back mappings which have an unexpected boomeranging effect. The first is from groove 
patterns to sounds, carried out by a phonograph. The second-familiar, but usually 
ignored — is from sounds to vibrations of the phonograph. Note that the second mapping 
exists independently of the first one, for any sound in the vicinity, not just ones produced 
by the phonograph itself, will cause such vibrations. The paraphrase of Godel's Theorem 
says that for any record player, there are records which it cannot play because they will 
cause its indirect self-destruction. [Drawing by the author. 



Implicit Meanings of the Contracrostipunctus 

What about implicit meanings of the Dialogue? (Yes, it has more than one of these.) The 
simplest of these has already been pointed out in the paragraphs above-namely, that the 
events in the two halves of the dialogue are roughly isomorphic to each other: the 
phonograph becomes a violin, the Tortoise becomes Achilles, the Crab becomes the 
Tortoise, the grooves become the etched autograph, etc. Once you notice this simple 
isomorphism, you can go a little further. Observe that in the first half of the story, the 
Tortoise is the perpetrator of all the mischief, while in the second half, he is the victim. 
What do you know, but his own method has turned around and backfired on him! 
Reminiscent of the backfiring of the records' muusic-or the goblet's inscription-or perhaps 
of the Tortoise's boomerang collection? Yes, indeed. The story is about backfiring on two 
levels, as follows ... 

Level One: Goblets and records which backfire; 

Level Two: The Tortoise's devilish method of exploiting implicit meaning to 
cause backfires-which backfires. 

Therefore we can even make an isomorphism between the two levels of the story, 
in which we equate the way in which the records and goblet boomerang back to destroy 
themselves, with the way in which the Tortoise's own fiendish method boomerangs back 
to get him in the end. Seen this 



Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 



92 



way, the story itself is an example of the backfirings which it discusses. So we can think 
of the Contracrostipunctus as referring to itself indirectly that its own structure is 
isomorphic to the events it portrays. (Exactly goblet and records refer implicitly to 
themselves via the back-to-back morphisms of playing and vibration-causing.) One may 
read the Dialogue without perceiving this fact, of course-but it is there all the time. 

Mapping Between the Contracrostipunctus 
and Godel's Theorem 

Now you may feel a little dizzy-but the best is yet to come. (Actually, levels of 
implicit meaning will not even be discussed here -they will 1 for you to ferret out.) The 
deepest reason for writing this Dialogue illustrate Godel's Theorem, which, as I said in 
the Introduction, heavily on two different levels of meaning of statements of number tl 
Each of the two halves of the Contracrostipunctus is an "isomorphic co Godel's Theorem. 
Because this mapping is the central idea of the Dialogue and is rather elaborate, I have 
carefully charted it out below. 

Phonograph <= =>axiomatic system for number theory 

low-fidelity phonograph <= =>"weak" axiomatic system 

high-fidelity phonograph <= =>"strong" axiomatic system 

"Perfect" phonograph" <= => complete system for number theory' 

Blueprint" of phonograph <= => axioms and rules of formal system 

record <= => string of the formal system 

playable record<= => theorem of the axiomatic system 

unplayable record <= =>nontheorem of the axiomatic system 

sound <= =>true statement of number theory 

reproducible sound <= => 'interpreted theorem of the system 

unreproducible sound <= => true statement which isn't a theorem: 

song title <= =>implicit meaning of Godel's string: 

"I Cannot Be Played "I Cannot Be Derived 

on Record Player X" in Formal System X" 

This is not the full extent of the isomorphism between Godel's theorem and the 
Contracrostipunctus, but it is the core of it. You need not if you don't fully grasp Godel's 
Theorem by now-there are still Chapters to go before we reach it! Nevertheless, having 
read this Dialogue you have already tasted some of the flavor of Godel's Theorem 
without necessarily being aware of it. I now leave you to look for any other types of 
implicit meaning in the Contracrostipunctus. "Quaerendo invenietis!"

The Art of the Fugue 



A few words on the Art of the Fugue ... Composed in the last year of Bach's life, it is a 
collection of eighteen fugues all based on one theme. Apparently, writing the Musical 
Offering was an inspiration to Bach. He decided to compose another set of fugues on a 
much simpler theme, to demonstrate the full range of possibilities inherent in the form. In 
the Art of the Fugue, Bach uses a very simple theme in the most complex possible ways. 
The whole work is in a single key. Most of the fugues have four voices, and they 
gradually increase in complexity and depth of expression. Toward the end, they soar to 
such heights of intricacy that one suspects he can no longer maintain them. Yet he does . . 
. until the last Contrapunctus . 

The circumstances which caused the break-off of the Art of the Fugue (which is to 
say, of Bach's life) are these: his eyesight having troubled him for years, Bach wished to 
have an operation. It was done; however, it came out quite poorly, and as a consequence, 
he lost his sight for the better part of the last year of his life. This did not keep him from 
vigorous work on his monumental project, however. His aim was to construct a complete 
exposition of fugal writing, and usage of multiple themes was one important facet of it. In 
what he planned as the next-to-last fugue, he inserted his own name coded into notes as 
the third theme. However, upon this very act, his health became so precarious that he was 
forced to abandon work on his cherished project. In his illness, he managed to dictate to 
his son-in-law a final chorale prelude, of which Bach's biographer Forkel wrote, "The 
expression of pious resignation and devotion in it has always affected me whenever I 
have played it; so that I can hardly say which I would rather miss-this Chorale, or the end 
of the last fugue." 

One day, without warning, Bach regained his vision. But a few hours later, he 
suffered a stroke; and ten days later, he died, leaving it for others to speculate on the 
incompleteness of the Art of the Fugue. Could it have been caused by Bach's attainment 
of self-reference? 

Problems Caused by Godel's Result 

The Tortoise says that no sufficiently powerful record player can be perfect, in the 
sense of being able to reproduce every possible sound from a record. Godel says that no 
sufficiently powerful formal system can be perfect, in the sense of reproducing every 
single true statement as a theorem. But as the Tortoise pointed out with respect to 
phonographs, this fact only seems like a defect if you have unrealistic expectations of 
what formal systems should be able to do. Nevertheless, mathematicians began this 
century with just such unrealistic expectations, thinking that axiomatic reasoning was the 
cure to all ills. They found out otherwise in 1931. The fact that truth transcends 
theoremhood, in any given formal system, is called "incompleteness" of that system. 

A most puzzling fact about Godel's method of proof is that he uses 



Consistency, Completeness, and Geometry 



94 



reasoning methods which seemingly cannot be "encapsulated" -they re being incorporated 
into any formal system. Thus, at first sight, it seems that Godel has unearthed a hitherto 
unknown, but deeply significant, difference between human reasoning and mechanical 
reasoning. This mysterious discrepancy in the power of living and nonliving systems is 
mirrored in the discrepancy between the notion of truth, and that of theoremhood or at 
least that is a "romantic" way to view the situation. 

The Modified pq-System and Inconsistency 

In order to see the situation more realistically, it is necessary to see in, depth why 
and how meaning is mediated, in formal systems, by isomorphisms. And I believe that 
this leads to a more romantic way to view i situation. So we now will proceed to 
investigate some further aspects of 1 relation between meaning and form. Our first step is 
to make a new formal system by modifying our old friend, the pq-system, very slightly. 
We a one more axiom schema (retaining the original one, as well as the sin rule of 
inference): 

Axiom SCHEMA II: If x is a hyphen-string, then xp-qx is an axiom. 

Clearly, then, ~p-q~ is a theorem in the new system, and so ~p~q — . And yet, their 
interpretations are, respectively, "2 plus; equals 2", and "2 plus 2 equals 3". It can be seen 
that our new system contain a lot of false statements (if you consider strings to be 
statement Thus, our new system is inconsistent with the external world. 

As if this weren't bad enough, we also have internal problems with < new system, 
since it contains statements which disagree with one another such as -p-q~ (an old 
axiom) and -p-q- (a new axiom). So our system is inconsistent in a second sense: 
internally. 

Would, therefore, the only reasonable thing to do at this point be drop the new 
system entirely? Hardly. I have deliberately presented the "inconsistencies" in a wool- 
pulling manner: that is, I have tried to press fuzzy-headed arguments as strongly as 
possible, with the purpose of n leading. In fact, you may well have detected the fallacies 
in what I hi said. The crucial fallacy came when I unquestioningly adopted the very same 
interpreting words for the new system as I had for the old of Remember that there was 
only one reason for adopting those words in I last Chapter, and that reason was that the 
symbols acted isomorphically to concepts which they were matched with, by the 
interpretation. But when y modify the rules governing the system, you are bound to 
damage t isomorphism. It just cannot be helped. Thus all the problems which we 
lamented over in preceding paragraphs were bogus problems; they can made to vanish in 
no time, by suitably reinterpreting some of the symbols of system. Notice that I said 
"some"; not necessarily all symbols will have to mapped onto new notions. Some may 
very well retain their "meaning while others change.

Suppose, for instance, that we reinterpret just the symbol q, leaving all the others 
constant; in particular, interpret q by the phrase "is greater than or equal to". Now, our 
"contradictory" theorems -p-q-and -p-q~come out harmlessly as: "1 plus 1 is greater than 
or equal to 1", and "1 plus 1 is greater than or equal to 2". We have simultaneously gotten 
rid of (1) the inconsistency with the external world, and (2) the internal inconsistency. 
And our new interpretation is a meaningful interpretation; of course the original one is 
meaningless. That is, it is meaningless for the new system; for the original pq-system, it is 
fine. But it now seems as pointless and arbitrary to apply it to the new pq-system as it 
was to apply the "horse-apple-happy" interpretation to the old pq-system. 

The History of Euclidean Geometry 

Although I have tried to catch you off guard and surprise you a little, this lesson 
about how to interpret symbols by words may not seem terribly difficult once you have 
the hang of it. In fact, it is not. And yet it is one of the deepest lessons of all of nineteenth 
century mathematics! It all begins with Euclid, who, around 300 B.C., compiled and 
systematized all of what was known about plane and solid geometry in his day. The 
resulting work, Euclid's Elements, was so solid that it was virtually a bible of geometry 
for over two thousand years-one of the most enduring works of all time. Why was this 
so? 

The principal reason was that Euclid was the founder of rigor in mathematics. The 
Elements began with very simple concepts, definitions, and so forth, and gradually built 
up a vast body of results organized in such a way that any given result depended only on 
foregoing results. Thus, there was a definite plan to the work, an architecture which made 
it strong and sturdy. 

Nevertheless, the architecture was of a different type from that of, say, a 
skyscraper. (See Fig. 21.) In the latter, that it is standing is proof enough that its structural 
elements are holding it up. But in a book on geometry, when each proposition is claimed 
to follow logically from earlier propositions, there will be no visible crash if one of the 
proofs is invalid. The girders and struts are not physical, but abstract. In fact, in Euclid's 
Elements, the stuff out of which proofs were constructed was human language-that 
elusive, tricky medium of communication with so many hidden pitfalls. What, then, of 
the architectural strength of the Elements? Is it certain that it is held up by solid structural 
elements, or could it have structural weaknesses? 

Every word which we use has a meaning to us, which guides us in our use of it. 
The more common the word, the more associations we have with it, and the more deeply 
rooted is its meaning. Therefore, when someone gives a definition for a common word in 
the hopes that we will abide by that

definition, it is a foregone conclusion that we will not do so but will instead be guided, 
largely unconsciously, by what our minds find in their associative stores. I mention this 
because it is the sort of problem which Euclid created in his Elements, by attempting to 
give definitions of ordinary, common words such as "point", "straight line", "circle", and 
so forth. How can you define something of which everyone already has a clear concept? 
The only way is if you can make it clear that your word is supposed to be a technical 
term, and is not to be confused with the everyday word with the same spelling. You have 
to stress that the connection with the everyday word is only suggestive. Well, Euclid did 
not do this, because he felt that the points and lines of his Elements were indeed the 
points and lines of the real world. So by not making sure that all associations were 
dispelled, Euclid was inviting readers to let their powers of association run free ... 

This sounds almost anarchic, and is a little unfair to Euclid. He did set down 
axioms, or postulates, which were supposed to be used in the proofs of propositions. In 
fact, nothing other than those axioms and postulates was supposed to be used. But this is 
where he slipped up, for an inevitable consequence of his using ordinary words was that 
some of the images conjured up by those words crept into the proofs which he created. 
However, if you read proofs in the Elements, do not by any means expect to find glaring 
"jumps" in the reasoning. On the contrary, they are very subtle, for Euclid was a 
penetrating thinker, and would not have made any simpleminded errors. Nonetheless, 
gaps are there, creating slight imperfections in a classic work. But this is not to be 
complained about. One should merely gain an appreciation for the difference between 
absolute rigor and relative rigor. In the long run, Euclid's lack of absolute rigor was the 
cause of some of the most fertile path-breaking in mathematics, over two thousand years 
after he wrote his work. 

Euclid gave five postulates to be used as the "ground story" of the infinite 
skyscraper of geometry, of which his Elements constituted only the first several hundred 
stories. The first four postulates are rather terse and elegant: 

(1) A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. 

(2) Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. 

(3) Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as 

radius and one end point as center. 

(4) All right angles are congruent. 
The fifth, however, did not share their grace: 

(5) If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the 

inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines 
inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough

Though he never explicitly said so, Euclid considered this postulate to be somehow 
inferior to the others, since he managed to avoid using it in t proofs of the first twenty- 
eight propositions. Thus, the first twenty-eight propositions belong to what might be 
called "four-postulate geometry" that part of geometry which can be derived on the basis 
of the first to postulates of the Elements, without the help of the fifth postulate. (It is al 
often called absolute geometry.) Certainly Euclid would have found it 1 preferable to 
prove this ugly duckling, rather than to have to assume it. B he found no proof, and 
therefore adopted it. 

But the disciples of Euclid were no happier about having to assume this fifth 
postulate. Over the centuries, untold numbers of people ga untold years of their lives in 
attempting to prove that the fifth postulate s itself part of four-postulate geometry. By 
1763, at least twenty-eight deficient proofs had been published-all erroneous! (They were 
all criticized the dissertation of one G. S. Klugel.) All of these erroneous proofs involve a 
confusion between everyday intuition and strictly formal properties. It safe to say that 
today, hardly any of these "proofs" holds any mathematic or historical interest-but there 
are certain exceptions. 

The Many Faces of Noneuclid 

Girolamo Saccheri (1667-1733) lived around Bach's time. He had t ambition to 
free Euclid of every flaw. Based on some earlier work he h; done in logic, he decided to 
try a novel approach to the proof of the famous fifth: suppose you assume its opposite; 
then work with that as your fif postulate ... Surely after a while you will create a 
contradiction. Since i mathematical system can support a contradiction, you will have 
shown t unsoundness of your own fifth postulate, and therefore the soundness Euclid's 
fifth postulate. We need not go into details here. Suffice it to s that with great skill, 
Saccheri worked out proposition after proposition "Saccherian geometry" and eventually 
became tired of it. At one point, decided he had reached a proposition which was 
"repugnant to the nature of the straight line". That was what he had been hoping for- to his 
mind was the long-sought contradiction. At that point, he published his work under the 
title Euclid Freed of Every Flaw, and then expired. 

But in so doing, he robbed himself of much posthumous glory, sir he had 
unwittingly discovered what came later to be known as "hyperbolic geometry". Fifty 
years after Saccheri, J. H. Lambert repeated the "near miss", this time coming even 
closer, if possible. Finally, forty years after Lambert, and ninety years after Saccheri, 
non-Euclidean geometry was recognized for what it was-an authentic new brand of 
geometry, a bifurcation the hitherto single stream of mathematics. In 1823, non- 
Euclidean geometry was discovered simultaneously, in one of those inexplicable 
coincidences, by a Hungarian mathematician, Janos (or Johann) Bolyai, age twenty-one, 
and a Russian mathematician, Nikolay Lobachevskiy, ag thirty. And, ironically, in that 
same year, the great French mathematician

Adrien-Marie Legendre came up with what he was sure was a proof of Euclid's fifth 
postulate, very much along the lines of Saccheri. 

Incidentally, Bolyai's father, Farkas (or Wolfgang) Bolyai, a close friend of the 
great Gauss, invested much effort in trying to prove Euclid's fifth postulate. In a letter to 
his son Janos, he tried to dissuade him from thinking about such matters: 

You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to its very end. I have 
traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and joy of my life. I entreat 
you, leave the science of parallels alone.... I thought I would sacrifice myself for the sake 
of the truth. I was ready to become a martyr who would remove the flaw from geometry 
and return it purified to mankind. I accomplished monstrous, enormous labors; my 
creations are far better than those of others and yet I have not achieved complete 
satisfaction. For here it is true that si paullum a summo discessit, vergit ad imum. I turned 
back when I saw that no man can reach the bottom of this night. I turned back unconsoled, 
pitying myself and all mankind.... I have traveled past all reefs of this infernal Dead Sea 
and have always come back with broken mast and torn sail. Fhe ruin of my disposition and 
my fall date back to this time. I thoughtlessly risked my life and happiness sut Caesar aut 
nihil. ' 

But later, when convinced his son really "had something", he urged him to 
publish it, anticipating correctly the simultaneity which is so frequent in scientific 
discovery:
